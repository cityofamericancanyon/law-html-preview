Factors to be considered shall be: (1) Similarity of the general kinds of work performed, types of qualifications required, and the general working conditions. (2) History of representation in the city and similar employment; except however, that no unit shall be deemed to be an appropriate unit solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized. (3) Consistency with the organizational patterns of the city. (4) Number of employees and classifications, and the effect on the administration of employer-employee relations created by the fragmentation of classifications and proliferation of units. (5) Effect on the classification structure and impact on the stability of the employer-employee relationship of dividing a single or related classifications among two or more units.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 3.24.020 Definitions. Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter : \"Hotel\" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for use or occupancy by transients, including but not limited to dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, timeshare project or facility, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof, duplex, triplex, single-family dwelling units except any private dwelling house or other individually owned single-family dwelling house unit rented only occasionally (infrequently) and incidentally to the normal occupancy by the owner or his family; provided that the burden of establishing that the housing or facility is a hotel as defined herein shall be upon the owner or operator thereof who shall file with the tax administrator such information as the tax administrator may require, to establish and maintain such status. \"Occupancy\" means the use or possession, or the right or entitlement to the use or possession, of any hotel, room, rooms or any portion thereof offered for rent to be used or occupied for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes regardless of the purpose for which such rooms are rented or provided. \"Operator\" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, timeshare project or facility manager or operator, or in any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or its functions through a managing agent of any type or character, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter , and shall have jointly and severally the same duties and liabilities as the principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be in compliance by both. \"Person\" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. \"Rent\" means the amount of the consideration charged or chargeable to the tenant or person entitled to occupancy, for the occupancy of space, valued in money whether received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including the full value of receipts, cash, credits, property or services of any kind or nature, without any deduction whatsoever. \"Rent\" may have been, or may be in part, payable or paid prior to or following (in whole or in part) the occupancy to which it is attributable, and may have been paid in whole or in part in advance on a long-term basis, such as in a time-share project or similar arrangement. It is not the intent of this subsection to make the operator liable for the tax on uncollected rent. However, uncollected rent must be reported. \"Tax administrator\" means the city manager or his designated agent, whether a city employee or county officer or employee. \"Time-share occupancy\" means occupancy related to the situation wherein a purchaser receives the right or entitlement in perpetuity, for life, or for a term of years or other extended term, to the recurrent, exclusive use or occupancy of a lot, parcel, unit, room(s), hotel or portion thereof, or segment of real property, annually or on some other seasonal or periodic basis, for a period of time that has been or will be allotted from the use or occupancy periods into which the time-share project which is involved has been divided. The said right or entitlement to occupancy may attach in advance to a specific lot, parcel, unit, room(s), or portion of a hotel, or segment of real property, or may involve designation or selection of the same at a future time or times. \"Transient\" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license, timeshare arrangement or ownership or agreement, or other agreement of whatever nature, for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient if his actual total period of occupancy does not exceed thirty days. Unless day of occupancy or entitlement to occupancy by one person are consecutive without any break, then prior or subsequent periods of such occupancy or entitlement to occupancy shall not be counted when determining whether a period exceeds the stated thirty calendar days.

Insofar as the transient is concerned, the tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the operator or to the city. (B) For the purposes of this section , the rent deemed payable on account of time-share occupancy by a transient shall be the rental value of the unit or room(s) which accommodated such occupancy, which rental value shall be computed by determining the pro rata share of the total purchase price of the time-share right or entitlement (whether or not involving an estate or any ownership in real property), which share is allocable to the period of transient occupancy currently involved, and adding thereto the total applicable operating costs including, but not limited to, the applicable real and personal property taxes, plus the total amount of any and all fees, assessments, charges and expenses (not including the previously referred to taxes) charged by the operator as attributable to the time-share occupancy of the transient by whatever name such fees, assessments, charges or expenses may be denominated, whether \"occupying fee,\" \"maintenance or operations charge,\" \"per diem fee,\" \"management fee\" or like name or otherwise.

Likewise, the rights granted under a franchise are subject to the exercise of police and other powers the city now has or may later obtain, including but not limited to the power of eminent domain. (E) Franchise Not a Grant of Property Rights. A franchise does not convey title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. Rights granted may not be subdivided or subleased. (F) Possessory Interest of Public Property. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall notify the franchisee of potential tax liability for property taxes pursuant to Cal. Rev. and Tax Code \u00a7 107.6. (G) Franchise Nonexclusive. No franchise shall be exclusive, or prevent the city from issuing other franchises or authorizations, or prevent the city from itself constructing, operating, or repairing its own cable communications system with a franchise. (H) Franchise Term. Every franchise shall be for a term of years, which term shall be specified in the franchise. (I) Costs Borne by Franchisee. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a franchise, or required by law, all acts which a franchisee is required to perform under the franchise or applicable law must be performed at the franchisee's expense. (J) Failures to Perform. If a cable communications system operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the work and bill the operator therefor. The operator shall pay the amounts billed within thirty days. Nothing in this section shall preclude the city from exercising any other remedies available at law or in equity if the cable communications system operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 5.20.130 General conditions upon construction, operation and repair. (A) Franchisee Must Follow Local Rules. The construction, operation, and repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in compliance with all laws, ordinances, departmental rules, regulations, and practices of general applicability affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning and safety codes, construction standards, regulations for providing notice to persons that may be affected by system construction, and directives governing the time, place and manner in which facilities may be installed in the public rights-of-way. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property. (B) No Permit Without Franchise. A franchise is required before a permit may be issued for work associated with the construction of a cable communications system. Any permit issued for such work to a person that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee; the permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all facilities installed under the permit upon the city's demand. (C) Permits Must Be Obtained. Construction, operation, or repair of a cable communications system shall not commence until all required permits have been obtained from the proper city officials and all required fees have been paid. All work performed will be performed in strict accordance with the conditions of the permit. Upon order of the city, any work and/or construction undertaken that is not completed in compliance with the city's requirements, or which is installed without obtaining necessary permits and approvals shall be removed or worked halted until such permits are obtained. (D) No Interference. Interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing cable communications systems, must be minimized. The city may require a person using the public rights-of-way to cooperate with others through joint trenching and other arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way. (E) Plans for and Publicizing Work. Work shall be publicized as the city may direct from time to time. The publication of work may be used to notify the public and operators of other communications systems, of the impending work, in order to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the public. The city shall approve or disapprove any work or work plan submitted. (1) Each cable communications system operator shall provide the city a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will be affected. (2) The city may from time to time, when the city receives an application for a permit to use a particular route, or upon the city's own initiative, designate by published order a route or proposed route for installation of communications facilities and may (a) require all persons who wish to emplace underground facilities along that route or any part thereof to install them during a specified period and (b) otherwise prohibit emplacement of such facilities along the route or any part thereof for twenty-four months or after such other, longer period as is necessary to protect the public interest. (F) Existing Poles To Be Used. To the extent possible, operators of cable communications systems shall use existing poles and conduit. Additional poles may not be installed in the right-of-way without the permission of the city, nor may pole capacity be increased by vertical or horizontal extenders. (1) To minimize disruption of public passage or infrastructure, to forestall or relieve exhaustion of public rights-of-way capacity, or to protect environmentally sensitive areas, the city may require as a condition of issuing any public rights-of-way permit for erection of new poles or construction of underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation of or along any traveled way, that the franchisee, licensee, or holder of the rights-of-way permit provide pole space or empty conduits in excess of its own present and reasonably foreseeable requirements for the purpose of accommodating the city and/or other franchisees. (G) Undergrounding. (1) Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in an area in the city, every cable communications system operator in the same area must locate its cable communications system underground except where the city agrees to permit the cable communication system operator to do otherwise. (2) Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground within an area of the city, every cable communications system operator in the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground. (3) The city manager may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular system or facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or relocate facilities underground, where relocation is impracticable, where ordinary engineering practices make undergrounding impractical, or where the city and the subscriber's interest can be protected in another manner. Nothing in this subsection prevents the city from ordering communications facilities to be located or relocated underground under other provisions of the city code. (H) Prompt Repairs. Any and all public rights-of-way, other public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of a cable communications system shall be promptly repaired by the operator. Public property and public rights-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the city and to a condition as good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred. No tree trimming shall be performed without the permission of the city and other affected authorities, and any tree trimming must be performed in strict accordance with the city code. (I) Movement of Facilities for Government. (1) A cable communications system operator shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public rights-of-way construction and repair (including regrading, resurfacing or widening); public right-of-way vacation; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government owned system or utility, public work, public facility, or improvement; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the cable communications system. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the \"public work.\" (2) Except in the case of emergency, the city shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed at least one week prior to the deadline by which a cable communications system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. Such action on the part of the franchisee shall be undertaken at no cost to the city. Provided that, in an emergency, or where a cable communications system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the cable communications system without further notice, and charge the cable communications system operator for costs reasonably incurred. (J) Movement for Others. (1) To accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person authorized to use the public rights-of-way or public property, a franchisee shall, by a time specified by such person, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, temporarily relocate or remove its facilities. The franchisee must be given written notice describing where the construction, operation or repair is to be performed at least fifteen days prior to the time by which its work must be completed. The costs to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person as provided in this chapter shall be the responsibility of the person requesting such accommodation. (2) A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires by a time specified to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. A cable communications system operator shall be given not less than seven days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. The expense of such temporary removal, relaying, relocation, or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. (K) Abandonment in Place. (1) A cable communications system operator may abandon any property in place in the public rights-of-way upon written notice to the city. However, if, within ninety days of the receipt of written notice of abandonment, the city determines, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public rights-of-way and facilities in the public rights-of-way will be adversely affected, the property must be removed by a date specified by the city. (2) A cable communications system operator that abandons its property must, upon request, transfer ownership of the properties to the city at no cost, and execute necessary quitclaim deeds and indemnify the city against future costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any environmental hazards associated with the abandoned property. (L) System Subject to Inspection. Every cable communications system shall be subject to inspection and testing by the city. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated or repaired. (M) Underground Services Alert. Each operator of a cable communications system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The operator shall identify the location of its cable communication system for the city at no charge. (N) Plan for Construction. Every franchise shall specify for the city a construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable communications system. The schedule shall provide for the prompt completion of the project, and shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, with benchmarks for deliverables and the areas of the city that will be affected. The city shall have the right to impose penalties on the operator for a failure to meet the accepted timetable and benchmarks. (O) Use of Facilities by the City. The city shall have the right to install and maintain, free of charge, upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a franchisee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable service operations of the franchisee. The city shall pay costs associated with attaching or affixing the city's wire or fixture to the franchisee's infrastructure. (Ord. 2005-03, 2005.)

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 5.20.140 Protection of the city and residents. (A) Indemnity Required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from the franchisee. The indemnity must: (1) Release the city from and against any and all loss, damage, expense, cost (without limitation the cost of litigation) liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable communications system.

(B) Insurance Required. A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall not commence construction or operation of the system without obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type satisfactory to the city. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. (C) Proof. Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance and naming the city as an additional insured, and other proofs as the city may find necessary, shall be filed with the city. For persons issued franchises after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter , certificates and other required proofs shall be filed within thirty days of the issuance of a franchise, prior to the commencement of construction, once a year thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this chapter , the certificate shall be filed within sixty days of the effective date of this chapter , annually thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the term of the franchise, then in that event, the cable communications system operator shall furnish, at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage has been obtained. (D) Certificate Contents. All certificates shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty days' prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state of California. Financial ratings of the insurer shall be no less than \"A\" VII or better in the latest edition of \"Bests Key Rating Guide,\" published by A.M. Best Guide. (E) Insurance Amounts. A cable communications system operator (and those acting on its behalf to construct or operate the system) shall maintain the following minimum insurance. The city shall be named as an additional insured by endorsement on the general liability and automotive policies; those insurance policies shall be primary and contain a cross-liability clause. (1) Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability, bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered are: premises, operations, products/completed operations and certain contracts.

Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X - explosion, C - collapse, U - underground. (2) Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life of this contract to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each cable communications system operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each cable communications system operator. Each cable communications system operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. Workers' compensation insurance shall include a waiver of subrogation clause in favor of the city. The following minimum limits must be maintained: Workers' compensation Statutory Employer's liability $500,000.00 per occurrence (3) Comprehensive Auto Liability. Each Occurrence Annual Aggregate Bodily injury $1,000,000.00 $3,000,000.00 Property damage 1,000,000.00 3,000,000.00 Personal injury 1,000,000.00 3,000,000.00 Coverage shall include owned, hired, and nonowned vehicles. In every franchise agreement the city shall reserve the right to require any other insurance coverage it deems necessary depending upon exposures. (F) Construction Bond. Every operator of a cable communications system shall obtain and maintain a construction bond to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and any franchise. The amount of the bond shall be set in the city franchise, but shall not be less than ten percent of the estimated cost of constructing or (in the case of existing systems) upgrading the system, and shall include a sufficient amount to cover the removal of facilities and/or restoration of city facilities within the right-of-way. The bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. Bonds must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise. (G) Security Fund. Every cable communications system operator shall establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise, and to pay any taxes, fees, penalties or liens owed to the city. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the city. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the cable communications system operator shall, within fourteen days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the city for a franchisee where the city determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee's operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The city may from time to time require a franchisee to change the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed risks to the city and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or other payments to the city. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 5.20.150 Enforcement and remedies. (A) Franchise Violation-Notice and Procedures. Before revoking a franchise or issuing an order to assess liquidated damages, the city shall follow the procedures set forth below: (1) The city shall notify a cable communications system operator in writing of any alleged violation (\"violation notice\") of a franchise or this chapter . The violation notice shall: (a) identify the violation; (b) direct the cable communications system operator to cure the violation or show cause why the violation cannot or should not be cured; and (c) state the time for the cable communications system operator's response, which shall be at minimum thirty days from the date of issuance of the violation notice, except for violations that present a danger to public health, safety or welfare, in which case the time for response may be shortened; (2) Within the time period designated for response in the violation notice issue pursuant to subsection (A)(1) of this section , the cable communications system operator shall respond in writing to the city indicating that: (a) the cable communications system operator intends to contest the violation notice and describing all facts relevant to its claim; or (b) the cable communications system operator has completely cured the violation, in which case the cable communications system operator shall provide documentation demonstrating that the violation has been completely cured; or (c) the cable communications system operator has begun to correct the violation, however, the violation cannot be corrected immediately despite the cable communications system operator's continued due diligence, in which case the operator shall describe in detail the steps already taken and operator's proposed plan and time schedule for completely curing the violation. The city may accept, modify, or reject the cable communications system operator's proposed plan and time schedule for curing the violation. Correction of the violation is not complete until all damages and penalties owed are paid in full; (3) If the cable communications system operator contests the violation notice or the city determines that the cable communications system operator has failed to completely cure the violation, to submit an acceptable plan to cure the violation, or to work diligently to cure the violation, the city shall schedule a hearing before the city manager or the city manager's designee (\"violation hearing\"). The city shall provide cable communications system operator written notice of the violation hearing at least twenty days prior to the hearing (\"hearing notice\"); (4) The hearing notice shall indicate: (a) the time and place of the violation hearing; (b) the nature of the violation; and (c) the cable communications system operator's right to present oral and written testimony at an open and public meeting; (5) At the violation hearing, the city manager or the city manager's designee shall hear and consider evidence from the cable communications system operator, city staff and members of the public regarding the alleged violation. The cable communications system operator shall be given an opportunity to present any and all evidence relating to the alleged violation; (6) If, based upon the evidence presented at the violation hearing, the city manager or the city manager's designee finds that cable communications system operator has violated its franchise, this chapter or any applicable state or federal law, the city manager or the city manager's designee may issue an order assessing liquidated damages if provided for by the cable communications system operator's franchise, or, subject to subsection (B) of this section and the terms of the cable communications system operator's franchise, revoke or shorten the franchise. The cable communication system operator may appeal the decision to the city council; (7) If the cable communications system operator files a written appeal to the city council pursuant to subsection (A)(6) of this section , the city council shall hold a public hearing to consider the appeal. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the cable communications system operator at least twenty days prior to the hearing. Such notice shall include the information described in subsection (A)(4) of this section . If, based upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, the city council find that the cable communications system operator has violated its franchise, this chapter , or any applicable state or federal laws, the city council may issue an order assessing liquidated damages if provided for by the cable communications system operators' franchise, or, subject to subsection (B) of this section and the terms of the cable communications system operators' franchise, revoke or shorten the term of the franchise. (B) Revocation and Termination. The city council may revoke a franchise or reduce the term of a franchise if it finds, after complying with procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section , that a cable communications system operator has violated this chapter or its franchise or license; has defrauded or attempted to defraud the city or subscribers; or has attempted to evade the requirements of this chapter or its franchise or license. Except as to violations that are impossible to cure, and as provided in subsections (C) and (D) of this section , the franchise may only be revoked if the franchisee (1) was given notice of the default; and (2) thirty days to cure the default; and (3) the franchisee failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible to cure the default in thirty days. Any revocation proceeding must conducted in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. (C) Exception for Certain Acts. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations (provided that notice was provided pursuant to subsection (A) of this section ), and fraud and attempted fraud shall be deemed incurable. Further, the city may declare a franchise forfeited without opportunity to cure where a franchisee (1) voluntarily stops providing service it is required to provide; or (2) transfers the franchise without the prior consent of the city. (D) Effect of Termination or Forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a franchise, whether by action of the city as provided in subsection (C) of this section , or by passage of time, the franchisee must stop using the cable communications system for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The city may take possession of some or all of franchisee's facilities, consistent with provisions of applicable law, or require the franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the franchisee's facilities from the city, and restore affected property to its same or better condition. This provision does not permit the city to remove facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee holds a valid franchise issued by the city. (E) Remedies Cumulative. Remedies provided for under this chapter or under a franchise shall be cumulative. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify the city; or relieve a franchisee of its franchise obligations or limit the amounts owed to the city. (F) Liquidated Damages Required in Franchise. A franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall require liquidated damages, in an amount to be specified in the franchise, for specified breaches of the franchise including but not limited to, failure to commence construction, failure to meet construction plan benchmarks, failure to comply with rebuild plan benchmarks, failure to commence service, and material breach of franchise obligation(s). The franchise shall also provide that the city may withdraw liquidated damages owed from the grantee's security deposit, after complying with the procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section . Liquidated damages shall commence on that date that performance was due and/or failed, and continue until the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the grantee has fully performed its obligations giving rise to the payment of liquidated damages. Any obligation to pay liquidated damages does not in any way affect the grantee's obligation to pay franchise fees or perform other franchise obligations and such liquidated damages do not constitute franchise fees and are not subject to any limitations on franchise fees contained in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 542(b). Any obligation to pay liquidated damages are not costs of satisfying franchise requirements as provided in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.925. A grantee may not pass the cost of any liquidated damages to subscribers through subscriber rates or itemize or otherwise identify on subscriber bills any obligation grantee may have to pay liquidated damages. (G) Penalties, Fines and Other Monetary Sanctions. (1) Penalties. In addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter or otherwise available by law, the city shall have the power to impose civil penalties in the event a grantee violates any provision of this chapter , a franchise, or any regulation lawfully adopted thereunder. The amounts of such penalties shall be based on the following principles: (a) Penalties shall exceed the financial benefits to a grantee delaying or failing to comply with the applicable requirement; (b) Even where such benefits are not easily discernible, the penalties shall be high enough to have a significant deterrent effect on a grantee; and (c) Penalties shall be sufficient to protect the city and other affected parties against loss of revenues resulting from violations. (2) Other Monetary Sanctions. A franchise shall also provide for liquidated damages and other monetary sanctions, the amounts of which shall also reflect the foregoing principals. (3) Private Suit Against Grantee. (a) Any person or organization adversely affected by a violation, or by a pattern and practice of violations, shall have the right to sue a grantee in a court of competent jurisdiction for damages and for injunctive and other relief to require enforcement of the franchise. Organizations shall be entitled to sue on behalf of themselves or their members. (b) The remedy provided in this chapter shall be in addition to any remedies provided by law. (c) Except in emergency situations in which immediate relief is required, private litigants shall notify the city attorney not fewer than ten days prior to filing suit.

Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle were fifty dollars, grantee would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents and pay a franchise fee on that revenue. (B) The definition of gross revenue is to be as inclusive as possible consistent with existing applicable law. If a change in federal law occurs subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter , such change shall not impact the gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross revenues unless the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition in subsection (B) of this section .

(1) A franchisee shall provide a minimum of three channels for PEG access to each subscriber. (2) Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace as necessary, a dedicated, bi-directional fiber optic link (or link with equivalent or superior functionality, capacity and reliability) between its headend and a location designated by the city as the primary access center. (3) Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace activated two-way cable plant and all headend, cable plant, and node equipment required to make it operable so that the city, schools, and all designated PEG access centers and access facilities located within the franchise area will be able to send and receive signals (video, audio and data) using the activated two-way cable plant. (4) Each franchisee shall ensure that technically adequate signal quality, routing systems, and switching and/or processing equipment are initially and continuously provided for all access interconnections both within franchisee's cable system and with other cable systems throughout the duration of its franchise. (5) In the event a franchisee makes any change in the cable system and related equipment and facilities or in the franchisee's signal delivery technology which directly or indirectly substantially affects the signal quality or transmission of access programming, the franchisee shall at its expense take necessary steps or provide necessary technical assistance, including the acquisition of all necessary equipment, to ensure that the capabilities of access programmers are not diminished or adversely affected by such change. (6) A franchisee shall maintain all access channels (both upstream channels and downstream channels) and all interconnections of access channels at the same level of technical quality and reliability as the best commercial channels carried on the grantee's system. (C) Service to Franchise Area. It is the policy of the city to ensure that every cable system provide service in its franchise area upon request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within its franchise area, provided that, a franchise may permit a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must be provided within time limits specified in subsection (D) of this section . (D) Time for Extension. Except as a franchise otherwise provides, service must be extended upon request to any person or to any government building in a franchisee's franchise area (i) within seven days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; (ii) within ninety days of the request where an extension of one-half mile or less is required; or (iii) within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. (E) Technical Standards. A cable system within the city shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.601 and any other applicable technical standards. (F) Testing. Each operator shall perform at its expense such tests as may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in compliance with its obligations under applicable FCC standards, this chapter or a franchise. (G) Interconnection. Upon request of the city, every cable system shall be required to interconnect with every other cable system within the city, or adjacent to the city, on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I-Net services. (H) Continuity of Service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity.

The city council shall be responsible for issuing rate orders that establish rates or order refunds. (B) No Rate Discrimination. Except to the extent the city may not enforce such a requirement, an operator is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged; and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. (C) Redlining Prohibited. An operator shall not deny access or charge different rates to any group of subscribers or potential subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. (D) Customer Service. (1) Each operator must satisfy FCC, state and the city cable customer service standards and consumer protection standards. The city cable customer service standards may be adopted by resolution. In the case of a conflict among standards, the stricter standard shall apply. (2) For violation of cable customer service standards, penalties will be imposed as follows: (a) Two hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed six hundred dollars for each occurrence of material breach; (b) If there is a subsequent material breach of the same provision within twelve months, four hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed one thousand two hundred dollars for each occurrence of the material breach; (c) If there is a third or additional material breach of the same provision within twelve months of the first, one thousand dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each occurrence of the material breach.

(E) Issuance. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors above, and such other matters as it is required or entitled to consider, and subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate OVS agreement, it shall issue a franchise. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received.

(G) Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (F) of this section , an applicant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should issue even if the requirements of subsection (F)(4) and (5) of this section are not satisfied, by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system.

These requirements include but are not limited to the requirements set forth in FCC regulations, including 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.309 and other applicable law. To the extent the provisions of this section differ from applicable FCC regulations or any applicable law, the provision or provisions that impose the highest standard or greatest legal duties or obligations upon the Franchisee shall take precedence, unless a different order of precedence is expressly set herein. (1) Office Availability. 1.1 Each Franchisee will maintain at least one or more convenient locations in the City open for walk-in traffic at least ten (10) hours per day (except legal holidays) Monday through Friday, with some evening hours, and at least five (5) hours on Saturday to allow Subscribers to pay bills.

Each Franchisee will perform service calls, installations, and disconnects at least ten (10) hours per day Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, provided that a Franchisee will respond to outages twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. (2) Telephones. All Call Response statistics shall be measured on the basis of call response statistics in all call centers that serve Subscribers. If the call centers serve Subscribers located in other communities, the Franchisee shall ensure that call center representatives do not give priority or preferential treatment to Subscribers located in other communities.

Each Franchisee will establish a publicly listed local toll-free telephone number. Customer service representatives must answer the phone at least ten (10) hours per day, Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, for the purpose of receiving requests for service, inquiries, and complaints from Subscribers. After such business hours the phone will be answered so that customers can register complaints and report service problems on a twenty-four (24) hour per day, seven (7) day per week basis, and so that the Franchisee can respond to service outages as required herein. 2.2. Standards for Call Response. 2.2.1. Answer Time will not exceed thirty (30) seconds or four (4) rings. Under normal operating conditions the Franchisee shall meet this requirement at least ninety (90) percent of the time. 2.2.2. The average Speed of Answer shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds. Under normal operating conditions the Franchisee shall meet this requirement at least ninety (90) percent of the time. 2.2.3. The percentage of Calls Abandoned shall not exceed three (3) percent under normal operating conditions. 2.2.4. Subscribers shall receive a Trunks Busy signal less than three (3) percent of the time under normal operating conditions. 2.3. Call Response Reports. 2.3.1. Franchisee shall submit reports on Call Response statistics every calendar quarter, except as otherwise provided in this section . 2.3.2. If any of a Franchisee's quarterly Call Response statistics fail to demonstrate compliance with any applicable requirement, the Franchisee must thereafter submit monthly reports on all Call Response times until the Franchisee requests and the City approves resuming quarterly reporting. 2.3.3. Information in the reports about Call Response times shall be determined on the basis of the simple average of results during business hours under normal operating conditions for the entire reporting period, and any report submitted at the end of a calendar quarter shall report the total number of calls during the proceeding quarter and the average Call Response times during that quarter. 2.4. Other Reports. 2.4.1. A Franchisee shall submit reports on all customer service standards identified in this Section during each successive calendar quarter for the term of the Franchise except as otherwise might be provided herein. If a Franchisee's reports for two (2) quarters within a calendar year fail to demonstrate that the Franchisee has complied with any customer service standard in this section , the Franchisee shall thereafter submit monthly reports about performance of each such requirement until it reports three (3) consecutive months with less than five (5) percent deviation from any minimum required standard unless the Franchisee demonstrates to the City's satisfaction that the deviation occurred when it was not operating under normal operating conditions as defined in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.309 and reports on the nature and duration of such non-normal operating conditions. 2.4.2. Timing. A Franchisee shall submit reports within thirty (30) days after the close of the applicable reporting period. Each report shall include data from the applicable reporting period. 2.4.3. Each of the reporting requirements in this Section is self-executing and the Franchisee agrees that the City does not need to provide additional notice or an opportunity to cure in order to establish that the Franchisee has committed a breach of these requirements for the purposes of the Franchisee's obligation to pay liquidated damages as described in this Section . 2.4.4. Compliance. If a monthly or quarterly report indicated that a Franchisee has failed to meet any of the minimum required standards, the Franchisee shall provide a written explanation of the deviation within ten (10) business days of the report, including steps being taken to cure the deviation, and the time expected to implement the cure. A Franchisee must cure within thirty (30) days unless a longer period is agreed to in writing by the City, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld. (3) Scheduling Work. 3.1. All appointments for service, installation, or disconnection will be specified by date. Each Franchisee will set a specific time at which the work will be done, or offer a choice of time blocks, which will not exceed four (4) hours in length. A Franchisee my also, upon request, schedule service installation calls outside normal business hours, for the express convenience of the customer. 3.2. If at any time an installer or technician is late for an appointment and/or believes a scheduled appointment time will be missed, an attempt to contact the customer will be made before the time of appointment and the appointment rescheduled at a time convenient to the customer. If rescheduling is necessary, it is the Franchisee's burden to prove it met the appointment. 3.3. The Franchisee will offer and fully describe to Subscribers who have experienced a missed appointment (where the missed appointment was not the Subscriber's fault) that the Subscriber may choose between the following options: 3.3.1. Installation or service call free of charge, if the appointment was for an installation or service call for which a fee was to be charged; 3.3.2. One (1) month of the most widely subscribed to service tier free of charge for other appointments; and 3.3.3. An opportunity to elect remedies under California Civil Code 1722 , if applicable. 3.4. If the Franchisee makes reasonable and no less than three (3) attempts to confirm an appointment during the scheduled appointment time or appointment window and is unsuccessful in obtaining such confirmation, the Franchisee may assume that the customer has cancelled the appointment. (4) Service Standards. 4.1. Under normal operating conditions, requests for service, repair, and maintenance must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within twenty-four (24) hours, or before the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. 4.2. A Franchisee will respond to all other inquiries (including billing inquiries) within five (5) business days of the inquiry or complaint. 4.3. Under normal operating conditions, repairs and maintenance for outages or service interruptions must be completed within twenty-four (24) hours after the outage or interruption becomes known to Franchisee where the Franchisee has adequate access to facilities to which it must have access in order to remedy the problem. 4.4. Under normal operating conditions, work to correct all other service problems must be begun by the next business day after notification of the service problem, and must be completed within five (5) business days from the date of the initial request. 4.5. When normal operating conditions do not exist, a Franchisee will complete the work in the shortest time possible. 4.6. A Franchisee will not cancel a service or installation appointment with a customer within 24 hours of the appointment or after the close of business on the business day preceding the scheduled appointment, whichever is earlier. 4.7. Requests for additional outlets, service upgrades or other connections (e.g., DMX, VCR, A/B switch) separate from the initial installation will be performed within seven (7) business days after an order has been placed. 4.8. Under normal operating conditions, the service standards set out in Sections 4.14.7 will be met at least ninety-five (95) percent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. 4.9.

(22) Deposits. A Franchisee may require a reasonable, non-discriminatory deposit on equipment provided to Subscribers. Deposits will be placed in an interest-bearing account, and the Franchisee will return the deposit, plus interest earned to the date the deposit is returned to the Subscriber, less any amount the Franchisee can demonstrate should be deducted for damage to such equipment.

This chapter aims to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare during the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emergency by requiring grocery stores to provide hazard pay for grocery workers performing work in the city of American Canyon. Some grocery stores have voluntarily provided additional compensation, but others have not. Requiring competing grocery stores to provide hazard pay will ensure that grocery workers are compensated for the risks of working during a pandemic. Grocery workers face increased risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 because the nature of their work involves close contact with the public and co-workers, including individuals who are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 but who can spread the disease. Hazard pay also ensures the retention of these essential grocery store workers who are on the frontlines of this pandemic providing essential services and who are needed throughout the duration of the COVID-19 emergency.", "num": "5.70.010", "path": "library|City of American Canyon, Cal., Code|5|5.70|5.70.010", "title": "5.70.010 Purpose.", "url": "/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.70.010"}

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 8.16.050 Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. \"Accessory use\" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. \"Alluvial fan\" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. \"Apex\" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. \"Appeal\" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter . \"Area of shallow flooding\" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. \"Area of special flood hazard.\" See \"Special flood hazard area.\" \"Area of special flood-related erosion hazard\" is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). \"Area of special mudslide (i.e. mudflow) hazard\" is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). \"Base flood\" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the \"100-year flood\"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter . \"Basement\" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below ground level) on all sides. \"Breakaway walls\" are any type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which designed to break away under abnormally high tides or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions: 1. Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 2. The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood. \"Building.\" See \"Structure.\" \"Coastal high hazard area\" means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as zone V1\u2014V30, VE or V. \"Development\" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. \"Encroachment\" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings permanent structure or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. \"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision\" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. \"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision\" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacture homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). \"Flood, flooding, or flood water\" means: 1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 2. The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. \"Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)\" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special hazards and the floodway. \"Flood Hazard Boundary Map\" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. \"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)\" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. \"Flood Insurance Study\" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. \"Floodplain or flood-prone area\" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See \"Flooding.\" \"Floodplain administrator\" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. \"Floodplain management\" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. \"Floodplain management regulations\" means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and to the application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, site or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. \"Floodproofing\" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93 and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing). \"Flood-related erosion\" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. \"Flood-related erosion area\" or \"flood-related erosion prone area\" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage. \"Flood-related erosion area management\" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including, but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. \"Floodway\" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as \"regulatory floodway.\" \"Floodway fringe\" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the \"regulatory floodway\" where encroachment may be permitted. \"Fraud and victimization\" as related to Article V, Variance Procedure, of this chapter , means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increase risk of damage from floods, which future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. \"Functionally dependent use\" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carries out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. \"Governing body\" is the local governing unit (i.e. county or municipality) that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. \"Hardship\" as related to Article V, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. \"Highest adjacent grade\" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. \"Historic structure\" means any structure that is: 1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminary determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior to qualify as a registered historic district; 3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. \"Levee\" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. \"Levee system\" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. \"Lowest floor\" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. See \"Basement.\" 1. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: a. The wet floodproofing standard in Section 8.16.160(C)(3) ; b. The anchoring standards in Section 8.16.160(A) ; c. The construction materials and methods standards in Section 8.16.160(B) ; and d. The standards for utilities in Section 8.16.170 . 2. For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements. See \"Basement.\" This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. \"Manufactured home\" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term \"manufactured home\" does not include a \"recreational vehicle.\" \"Manufactured home park or subdivision\" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. \"Market value\" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. \"Mean sea level\" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVFD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. \"Mudslide\" describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. \"Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area\" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. \"New construction,\" for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the \"start of construction\" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. \"New manufactured home park or subdivision\" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. \"Obstruction\" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. \"One-hundred-year flood\" or \"100-year flood.\" See \"Base flood.\" \"Primary frontal dune\" means a continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and adjacent to the beach and subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during major coastal storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where there is a distinct change from a relatively mild slope. \"Public safety and nuisance\" as related to Article V, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. \"Recreational vehicle\" means vehicle which is: 1. Built on a single chassis; 2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 3. Designed to be self-propelled permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. \"Regulatory floodway\" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. \"Remedy a violation\" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. \"Riverine\" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. \"Sand dunes\" means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach. \"Sheet flow area.\" See \"Area of shallow flooding.\" \"Special flood hazard area (SHFA)\" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-30, AE, A99, AH, V1\u2014V30, VE OR V. \"Start of construction\" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or to other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. \"Structure\" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. \"Substantial damage\" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. \"Substantial improvement\" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the \"start of construction\" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred \"substantial damage,\" regardless of the actual repair work preformed. The term does not, however, include either: 1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 2. Any alteration of a \"historic structure,\" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a \"historic structure.\" \"Variance\" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter . \"Violation\" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter . A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. \"V Zone.\" See \"Coastal high hazard area.\" \"Water surface elevation\" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplain of coastal or riverine areas. \"Watercourse\" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.

(A) The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 15, 1989, accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway (FBFMs), dated 1980 and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter . This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 4381 Broadway, Suite 201, American Canyon, CA 94503 City Hall, or at 205 Wetlands Edge Road American Canyon, CA 94503, Department of Public Works. (B) Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations: (1) Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). (2) All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permit. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the \"start of construction\" definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 8.16.240 Nature of variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 8.16.260 Conditions for variances. (A) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; providing, that the procedures of Articles III and IV of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. (B) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of \"historic structures\" (as defined in Section 8.16.050 of this chapter ) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. (C) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. (D) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the \"minimum necessary\" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. \"Minimum necessary\" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter . For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. (E) Variances shall only be issued upon a: (1) Showing of good and sufficient cause; (2) Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional \"hardship\" (as defined in Section 8.16.050 of this chapter ) to the applicant; and (3) Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 8.16.050 ), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 8.16.050 ) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. (F) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use; provided, that the provisions of subsections A through E are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. (G) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 8.16.250(C) and the purposes of this chapter , the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter .

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 9.07.030 Legislative findings. The city of American Canyon council finds as follows: (A) The city of American Canyon, pursuant to the police powers delegated to it by the California Constitution, has the authority to enact laws which promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its residents; (B) The occurrence of a party, gathering or event on private property where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession or control of an underage person is harmful to underage persons themselves and a threat to the public health, safety, or quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare; (C) Section 25658 of the Business and Professions Code makes it unlawful for a person under the age of twenty-one years to purchase or attempt to purchase, or consume alcoholic beverages and makes it unlawful for any person to sell or provide any alcoholic beverage to any person under the age of twenty-one years. (D) Law enforcement response to a party, gathering or event where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession or control of an underage person causes a drain of law enforcement resources and in some situations, leaves other areas of the city with inadequate law enforcement protection. Responses to such gathering or events result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents. (E) According to the California Healthy Kids Survey (2008), thirty percent of Napa County 11th graders report obtaining alcohol at parties or other events outside school and seventy-eight percent of Napa County 11th graders report that alcohol is fairly easy or very easy to obtain. Alcohol policy research regarding underage drinking shows that when communities reduce youth access to alcohol, communities experience reductions in youth alcohol use and related problems. Ordinances that reduce youth access to alcohol from social sources have been recognized as a best practice by the United States Department of Justice. (F) Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at a party, gathering or event held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the underage service and/or consumption. (G) Persons responsible for the occurrence of a party, gathering or event on private property where alcoholic beverages are served have a duty to ensure that alcohol is not served to, consumed by or in the possession or control of an underage person at such gatherings. (H) Communities that have adopted such ordinances have seen reductions in the size of parties, gatherings and events and reductions in youth perception of ease of access to alcohol. (I) Law enforcement ability to abate gatherings where alcohol is consumed by minors on private property will help to decrease abuse of alcohol by minors, physical altercations and injuries, sexual assaults, truancy, driving under the influence of alcohol, adolescent crime, motor vehicle collisions, neighborhood vandalism and excessive noise disturbance thereby improving public safety and overall quality of life of American Canyon residents. (J) Persons held responsible for abetting or allowing a party, gathering or event, where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession or control of an underage person will be more likely to properly supervise or to stop such conduct at gatherings held on property in their possession or under their control. (K) Problems associated with a party, gathering or event where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by or in the possession or control of underage persons are difficult to prevent or deter unless law enforcement has the additional legal authority to issue a civil citation for a civil fine and/or a civil citation for the cost of public safety response. (L) The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare, rather than to punish. Persons who actively or passively aid, abet, or allow a party, gathering or event where alcohol is served to, consumed by or in the possession of an underage person shall be held liable for the nuisances created by such gatherings, the civil fine(s) for such violations and the costs associated with responding to such gatherings.

(2) Since nonrepairable vehicle certificate status allows for the vehicle in question to be exempt from being titled or registered, a time limit of six months will be allowed for the owner of said vehicle to remove all parts desired and dispose of remaining portion of the vehicle. (3) A \"total loss salvage vehicle\" must be registered with the state Department of Motor Vehicles, but even with registration and due to the nature of the vehicle's overall condition, the owner must make a financial commitment to its complete repair and restoration to operational status and repair work must be substantially in progress by the sixth month after the vehicle is first stored on private property, or the vehicle shall be subject to abatement by the city pursuant to this chapter .

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 10.36.130 Recovery of abatement costs by city. (A) Cost Recovery Procedures. (1) The city may recover reasonable costs incurred in the abatement of motor vehicles, or parts of motor vehicles, pursuant to this chapter through the procedures set forth in this section , pursuant to state Vehicle Code Section 22660 . (2) Such abatement costs may be made a personal debt of the vehicle owner or the owner of the property from which the vehicle was removed, or a special assessment against any real property owned by the vehicle owner or the property from which the vehicle was removed. (B) Report on Abatement Costs. The city manager or his or her designee shall keep a detailed itemized report of the expenses incurred by the city in the abatement of any vehicles pursuant to this chapter . Upon completion of the work, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable, the city manager shall file with the city clerk a report which specifies the address or location of the property from which the vehicle was removed, the license plate, or vehicle identification number for the vehicle, the year, make, model and color of the vehicle, the nature of the work performed in removing the vehicle, and the itemized and total cost of this work. (C) Notice of Hearing Before City Council. Upon receipt of the report of the city manager, the city clerk shall set a hearing on the report before the city council, on a date which is no less than ten and no more than sixty days after service of the report on the property owner and the vehicle owner. A notice which specifies the date, time and place of the hearing and the total amount of the expenses for the abatement of the vehicle, shall be served on the owner of the real property from which the vehicle was removed and the vehicle owner, if known, by certified mail. If the address of the owner of the vehicle is not known, the city shall post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property from which the vehicle or parts of a vehicle were removed and shall publish a copy of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, at least twice, no less then ten days before the hearing. (D) Hearing Before City Council. Unless otherwise continued for good cause, the city council shall hold the hearing at the date, time and place specified on the notice served on the vehicle owner and the property owner. At the hearing, the city manager shall present the report to the city council, and the vehicle owner and property owner shall have the right to present any objections to the report. The city manager, the vehicle owner, and the property owner shall have the right to be represented by counsel. (E) Decision of the City Council. At the conclusion of the hearing or within thirty days thereafter, the city council shall approve, reject or modify the city manager's report on expenses incurred in the abatement of the vehicle and shall issue a written decision which specifies the amount and nature of the approved expenses incurred by the city that shall be recovered from the vehicle owner or property owner and that such expenses shall be made either a personal debt of the vehicle owner or property owner or a special assessment against any real property owned by the vehicle owner or the property from which the vehicle was removed. If the amount of any special assessment imposed exceeds five hundred dollars, the city council may provide in its decision that the special assessment shall be payable in not more than five equal annual installment payments. A copy of the city council's decision shall be served on the vehicle owner and property owner through the procedure specified by state law for the service of a summons. The notice shall specify that the property may be sold after three years by the county tax collector for unpaid assessments. (F) Recordation of Notices for Special Assessment. If the city council's decision designates the amount of approved abatement expenses as a special assessment against real property owned by the vehicle owner or the property from which the vehicle was removed, the city manager shall cause a copy of all notices given to the property owner or vehicle owner, and the city council's decision to be recorded at the office of the county recorder. (G) Status of Special Assessment for Vehicle Abatement Costs. The abatement costs approved by the city council shall immediately, upon recordation, constitute a special assessment lien against the property. Such special assessment lien shall be subordinate to any existing special assessment which exists on the same property, but shall be paramount to all other liens except for state, county and municipal taxes with which the special assessment lien shall be in parity. (H) Method for Collection of Special Assessment. The assessment shall be collected by the county tax collector at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall apply to this special assessment. However, if the real property on which the special assessment is placed has been transferred to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if the lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon prior to the date on which the first installment of the special assessment becomes delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured tax roll for collection. (I) Sale of Property for Payment of Delinquent Special Assessment. The city may, subject to the requirements of state law, conduct a sale of vacant developed residential real property owned by the vehicle owner for which the payment of the special assessment is delinquent. (J) Delinquent Assessments. All special assessments imposed for the removal of any vehicle subject to this chapter which remain unpaid after thirty days from the date for the recordation on the assessment roll shall become delinquent and shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent per year. The city may collect the debt through any legal means. (K) Council Decision to Make Abatement Costs a Personal Debt of Vehicle Owner or Property Owner. As an alternative to making the city's abatement costs a special assessment on real property owned by the vehicle owner or property owner, the city council may designate that such approved abatement expenses shall be a personal debt of the vehicle owner or property owner which is payable within thirty days. (L) Delinquent Debts. If the vehicle owner or property owner fails to pay the entire amount due within this time, the debt shall become delinquent and may be collected by the city through any legal means. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid debt at the rate of ten percent per year. (M) Definition of Abatement Costs. For the purposes of this section , abatement costs shall include, but not be limited to, the city's costs incurred in removing the vehicle from the property by its own personnel, or by contract with a third party, costs incurred in giving required notices to the property owner and the owner of the vehicle, enforcement costs, including but not limited to, inspections, communications with the property and vehicle owner, and legal costs incurred in any judicial, administrative or special proceeding to abate the vehicle, and costs for the obtaining of an inspection warrant or other judicial order which authorizes removal of the vehicle from the property. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to any prevailing party in the action, but shall not in any case, exceed the reasonable amount of attorneys' fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding. The city may designate at the beginning of any judicial, administrative or special proceeding whether it will apply for an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party.

(2) The city shall treat employer budget information submitted pursuant to subsection (H)(1)(e) of this section in a confidential manner and shall not release any budget information about individual employers to the public. Aggregate and generic budget information for trip reduction programs and measures shall be within the public domain. (K) Performance Objective Calculation. AVR or VER for each affected work site is to be computed in a manner consistent with the following method. (1) The employer conducts an employee transportation survey during a survey week. (2) AVR is calculated only for' those employees who start work or are assigned to the work site during the peak period. (3) If less than sixty percent of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period, all survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be counted as single occupant vehicles for purposes of calculating AVR or VER. (4) If sixty percent or more of the survey forms are returned for processing from those employees who start work during the peak period, one-half of those survey forms not returned from those employees who start work during the peak period shall be assumed to have the same AVR or VER as that calculated from the responses to the surveys returned, and one-half shall be counted as single occupant vehicles for purposes of calculating AVR or VER. (5) AVR for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total \"employee-days\" for the survey week by the total \"vehicle trip-days\" for the survey week. (6) VER for the work site shall be calculated by dividing the total \"vehicle trip-days\" for the survey week by the total \"employee-days\" for the survey week. (a) Employee-days shall be determined as follows: the, total number of employees who start work or are assigned to a work site during the peak period each work day Monday through Friday of the survey week. Each day of the survey week that an employee starts work during the peak period counts as one employee-day. For example, an employee who starts work each day Monday through Friday of the survey week between six a.m. and ten a.m. counts as five employee-days. The following procedures are used in totaling employee-days: (i) Employees telecommuting or are off due to a compressed work week schedule are counted as reporting to the work site in calculating the total employee-days. (ii) The following employees are not included in the employee-days total: (A) Employees not working because of vacation, sickness or other time-off, (B) Employees who report to a different work site or an off-site work related activity, (C) Disabled employees. (b) Vehicle trip-days shall be determined as follows: the total number of vehicles used by employees who start work or are assigned to the worksite each work day Monday through Friday of the survey week. A vehicle trip-day is based on the means of transportation used for the greatest distance of an employee's home to work commute trip. An employee who starts work during the peak period and arrives at the work site each day of the survey week Monday through Friday in a single occupant vehicle counts as five vehicle trip-days. The following numerical values are used in calculating the total vehicle trip-days: (i) Single occupant vehicle (drive alone) equals one, (ii) Carpool equals one divided by the number of people in the carpool, (iii) Vanpool equals one divided by the number of employees in the vanpool, (iv) Motorcycle, moped, motorized scooter, or motor bike equal one, (v) Clean-fueled vehicles are counted as follows: (A) Electric vehicle equals zero, (B) Compressed natural gas vehicle equals one-fourth (0.25), (C) Propane vehicle equals one-half (0.50), (D) Dual or flexible fueled vehicle equals three-fourths (0.75). (vi) The following all equal zero vehicle trip-days: (A) Public transit (bus, light rail, ferry, Caltrain, BART), (B) Private buspool or club bus, (C) Bicycle, (D) Walking and other nonmotorized transportation modes, (E) Employees telecommuting (only on the days those employees are telecommuting for the entire day), (F) Employees who work a compressed work week schedule (only on their compressed day(s) off), (G) Disabled employee vehicles at all times. (vii) Employers with multiple work sites within the city have the option to average individual work site AVR or VER to demonstrate that the performance objectives are achieved on an aggregate basis for those work sites when the city is implementing the chapter. If the employer demonstrates that the performance objectives (subsection D of this section ) are achieved using the averaging methodology, then those work sites included in the averaging are not subject to the requirements of subsection H of this section . (A) The weighted AVR average for the multiple work sites is calculated by (1) adding together the \"employee-days\" for each work site (2) adding together the \"vehicle trip-days\" for each work site, then (3) dividing the aggregate \"employee-days\" by the aggregate \"vehicle trip-days\" to obtain the weighted AVR average. (B) The weighted VER average for the multiple work sites is calculated by dividing the aggregate \"vehicle trip-days\" by the aggregate \"employee-days.\" (C) The weighted VER average for multiple work sites can also be calculated as the number of peak period employees multiplied by VER (Site 1) plus the number of peak period employees multiplied by VER (Site 2) divided by the total peak period employees (Sites 1 and 2). (L) Random Sample Method. The method described in this section must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of subsection K of this section . (1) Summary. (a) Subsection (G)(3) of this section provides for an option for larger work sites to calculate AVR or VER based upon a random sample of the employee population. The random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred or more employees start work during the peak period (six a.m. through ten a.m.). (b) The size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site. The means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in subsection (L)(2)(b) of this section . (c) The sample must be selected as described in subsection (L)(2)(d) of this section . Once the sample group has been selected, the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group. This will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employer's option to utilize the random sample method. (d) A high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate AVR or VER for the work site. The employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample. All nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive along commuters (i.e. commuting in a single occupant vehicle) for purposes of calculating the work site AVR or VER. (2) Basic Random Sample Selection Methodology. (a) The employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site, in alphabetical order, and assign a consecutive number to each employee. The employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the six am. through ten a.m. peak period. (b) The employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula, where n is the sample size and N is the number of employees who start work between six am and ten a.m. A sample size of \"n\" based on this formula should produce an AVR or VER with a sampling error of at most plus or minus 0.05, with ninety-five percent probability. The sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below: Number of Peak Period Employees at Work Site Sample Size 400 to 420 200 421 to 440 205 441 to 460 210 461 to 480 214 481 to 500 218 501 to 550 225 551 to 600 235 601 to 650 240 651 to 700 248 701 to 750 255 751 to 800 260 801 to 850 265 851 to 900 270 901 to 950 274 951 to 1,000 278 1,001 to 1,500 300 1,501 to 2,000 320 2,001 to 3,000 340 3,001 to 4,000 350 4,001 to 6,000 360 6,001 to 10,000 370 &gt;10,001 380 (c) In no case can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table. The employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey. A larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population, provided that the employer obtains a high response rate. (d) After the sample size has been determined, the employer has two options for selecting the sample. (i) Use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list (e.g., two hundred seventy-eight distinct random numbers between one and one thousand, where one thousand employees start working during the peak period). (ii) Select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number. To determine the sample interval, the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the six a.m. through ten am. peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer. Example: If a work site has one thousand employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is two hundred seventy-eight, then the sampling interval equals 1,000 divided by 278 = 3.6. The 3.6 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval. Therefore, every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number X where X is between 1 and 3. If X equals 3, then the sample would include numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc., until the required 278 numbers have been selected. (e) The methodology described in subsection (L)(2)(d) of this section will eliminate potential bias that could result from choosing survey participants on the basis of department, rank, income level, home code, or other demographic factors, or from excluding certain segments of the employee population. (3) Selection Process for Subsequent Surveys. (a) In subsequent surveys, the employer may select the random sample using the method described in subsection (L)(2) of this section or the employer may choose to survey the same employees that were included in the previous random sample. Employees in the previous random sample group who have left the orgrni7ation shall be replaced in the new sample by employees selected per subsection (L)(2) of this section . The latter approach may enable the employer to more accurately track changes in commute mode from one survey to next. (b) If the number of employees who start work between six a.m. and ten a.m. has increased or decreased by more than twenty percent since last survey, the employer shall select a completely new random sample group using the methodology describe in subsection (L)(2) of this section . (4) Performance Objective Calculation, Reporting and Recordkeeping. (a) AVR or VER must be calculated according to the methodology describe in subsection K of this section . Notwithstanding, the provision of subsection (K)(4) of this section , any employee in the random sample group who fails to submit a completed survey form shall be included in the performance objective calculation as a drive long commuter (single occupant vehicle).

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 13.10.010 Legislative findings. The city council of the city finds and declares the following: (A) Under state law, the city may provide water and sewer connections and service to residences and businesses within its corporate boundaries before committing to provide water and sewer connections and services to developments outside city limits; (B) The city has approved and may have applications in the future for new developments for residential, commercial and industrial uses that will require water and sewer connections and service; (C) Applications for the annexation of various properties to the city and the American Canyon fire protection district, a subsidiary district of the city (district) are currently pending before the Napa County local agency formation commission (LAFCO), and other applications may be submitted in the future from time to time; (D) Applications for new developments that will require large amounts of water which will be located in unincorporated county territory are pending before the county of Napa (county) and to date, applications for the annexation of these developments into the city have not been filed with LAFCO; (E) The city's primary obligation as a local government is to provide water and sewer connections and service within its boundaries or to those developments where applications for annexation to the city are pending before LAFCO, rather than to developments in unincorporated county territory; (F) The city is committed to the prudent management of its resources and to its economic growth and development; (G) Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with the City-County Agreement, the city will provide water service to all outside customers and other outside customers upon request under all of the same terms and conditions under which the city provides water service to city customers, and the city will not impose any term or condition on any water service to any outside customer and other outside customers that is different from the terms and conditions that the city imposes on city customers, except that the city may continue to impose higher water rates on outside customers and other outside customers consistent with Hansen v. City of San Buenaventura (1986) 42 Cal.3d 1172; (H) The city shall continue to provide water service to existing outside customers and other outside customers and, upon request, the city shall provide new or increased water service to all outside customers and other outside customers under the same terms and conditions under which the city provides water service to city customers, as provided in subsection G of this section . The city shall provide all new city customers, all new outside customers and other outside customers with water service under the conditions set forth in subsection I of this section ; (I) Water Conditions to be Imposed on all Parcels (City Customers, Outside Customers and Other Outside Customers) for which New Water Service is Requested. The city may impose the conditions listed below on new water services for outside customers and other outside customers by including these conditions in the \"will-serve\" letters that the city provides to such customers, but only if the city also imposes the same conditions on all new water services for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits. Napa County shall include these same conditions in all new land use development permits for parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area. (1) City Capacity Fees and Conditions of Approval for Water Service. Capacity fees charged for parcels within the city's water service area shall be established by the city and will be periodically reviewed and updated. Capacity fees (also known as connection fees) will be uniform throughout the water service area, regardless of whether the parcel to which the fee applies is inside or outside the city's limits. The capacity fee and any conditions on new water service will be determined based on the Water Supply Report, which shall contain the analysis described in the City-County Agreement Part II.C. of Exhibit F, and which will be consistent with the city's Zero Water Footprint Policy, adopted by the city on October 23, 2007, or as may be subsequently amended. (2) Cost of Water Service. The cost of new water service shall be imposed through the capacity fees in the city's Ordinance 2007-09 or through new capacity fees approved by Napa County and enacted in a new city ordinance. However, if the Water Supply Report finds, consistent with the city's Zero Water Footprint Policy or as may be subsequently amended (see City-County Agreement Exhibit F), that the city will have to obtain additional water supplies to meet \"dry year\" shortfalls, then the cost of water to meet such \"dry year\" shortfalls will be the sole responsibility of the applicant. In determining whether or not such \"dry year\" shortfalls will occur, the city shall include in the base supplies available to the city during \"dry years\" the new water supplies that have been or will be included in the calculations used to set the city's capacity fees and water rates. The city will conclude that \"dry year\" shortfalls will occur only if such base supplies will not be adequate to meet anticipated \"dry year\" demands. The city may not impose any costs on the applicant under this section to reimburse the city for any capital or operating costs that have been or will be included in the calculations used to set the city's capacity fees or water rates. The city may impose the additional costs described in the preceding sentence on outside customers and other outside customers only if the city also imposes such additional costs uniformly on city customers. (3) Maximum Allowable Water Use. Water received from the city for use on parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area and on parcels with similar uses within the city's limits and other outside customers with similar uses shall be limited to an average of six hundred fifty gallons of water per day per acre (measured monthly), and applicants for new or increased city water service for all such parcels shall be required to demonstrate to the city while the city is preparing the Water Supply Report for the applicant the maximum extent to which the applicant can further reduce its water consumption by applying the following best management practices: (a) No Flow or Low Flow Fixtures. These applicants shall be required to install no flow or low flow water fixtures, and to implement other reasonable water conservation measures that are described in the city's Water Conservation Guidelines adopted in the city's Resolution No. 2008-08 or in new city water conservation guidelines approved by Napa County and adopted in a new city ordinance or resolution. (b) Drought Tolerant Landscape and Irrigation with Recycled Water. These applicants shall be required to use only drought tolerant landscaping, and they may only irrigate landscaped areas with recycled water, when it is available. (c) Purple Pipe. These applicants shall be required to dual plumb their buildings and install \"purple pipe\" in all landscape areas in anticipation of the availability of recycled water and shall use the recycled water when available. (d) These applicants shall follow the water conservation methods that are described in the Water Conservation Guidelines adopted in the city's Resolution No. 2008-08 or in new city water conservation guidelines approved by Napa County and adopted in a new city ordinance or resolution. The city may apply the provisions of this paragraph to applicants for new or increased city water service for parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area only if the city also uniformly applies these provisions to all applicants for new or increased city water service for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits and other outside customers. (4) Water Offsets. Applicants for city water service for parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area and for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits and other outside customers with parcels with similar uses that wish to use more than an average of six hundred fifty gallons of water per day per acre (measured monthly) shall offset the proposed water use over six hundred fifty gallons per day per acre (measured monthly) through the use of one or more options that are made available by the city to the applicants. These options include, but are not limited to, retrofitting of existing residences with low flow fixtures, purchase of otherwise developable land as permanent open space, or acquisition of other water supply resources as provided for by a water supply analysis that follows the Zero Water Footprint Methodology, or as may be subsequently amended, described in Exhibit F to the City-County Agreement. The city shall make all such options available uniformly to applicant for city water service for parcels within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan area and for parcels with similar uses within the city's limits and other outside customers with parcels with similar uses, and that seek such offsets. (5) Drought Restrictions. To the extent permitted by law, the city may curtail or ration the use of water provided by the city below the limit of six hundred fifty gallons per day per acre (measured monthly) in dry years through the imposition of drought restrictions that are uniformly applied throughout the city's water service area. (J) For purposes of this Chapter 13, \"city customers\" shall mean all persons and entities presently receiving water service from the city, and all persons and entities that are requesting or in the future request new or increased water service from the city, for parcels that are located within city's incorporated limits. (K) For purposes of this Chapter 13, \"outside customers\" shall mean all persons and entities presently receiving water service from the city, and all persons and entities that are requesting or in the future request new or increased water service from the city for parcels that are located outside the city's limits but within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan boundaries. (L) For purposes of this Chapter 13, \"other outside customers\" shall mean all persons and entities presently receiving water service from the city, and all persons and entities that are requesting or in the future request new or increased water service from the city for parcels that are located outside the city's limits but not within the Airport Industrial Area Specific Plan boundaries.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 13.14.070 Water conservation stages. The intent of this section is to provide for the escalation of customer demand management strategies that may be necessary due to an emergency caused by drought and/or water supply shortages. There are six stages of strategies, each of which builds upon its predecessor stage and are to be implemented as the severity of conditions increase. Stage 6 can be implemented at any time due to catastrophic events and conditions, either natural or unnatural, including flooding, major fire emergencies, earthquakes, regional power outages, water contamination, and emergencies other than water shortage. No customer of the city shall make, cause, use, or permit the use of water from the city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental, or any other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision of this chapter , or in an amount in excess of what is permitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter . The reductions shall be based upon the amount of water used during that base period defined as the amount of water used on a customer's property during the corresponding monthly billing period in the previous year, or other year as may be designated by the city council. New services or services without a base year billing history shall be allotted on comparable customer usage. (A) Stage 1\u2014Voluntary Conservation. The intent of Stage 1 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of ten percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 1 (Voluntary Conservation)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide reduction of ten percent is necessary. During Stage 1, all water customers of the city shall be requested to implement the following best practices: (1) Apply irrigation water only during the evening and early morning hours to reduce evaporation losses. (2) Utilize water conservation incentive, rebate and giveaway programs to replace water guzzling plumbing fixtures and appliances with water efficient models. (3) Utilize city information regarding using water efficiently, reading water meters, repairing ordinary leaks, and water efficient landscape. (4) Wash automobiles, trucks, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other types of mobile equipment during the evening and early morning hours to reduce evaporation losses. Such washing shall be done with a hand-held bucket, or hand-held hose equipped with a positive shutoff nozzle used for quick rinses. (5) Reduce monthly demand by ten percent when compared to the same time period in the established base year. (B) Stage 2\u2014Mandatory Compliance\u2014Water Alert. The intent of Stage 2 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of twenty percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 2 (Mandatory Compliance\u2014Water Alert)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide reduction of twenty percent is necessary. In addition to the mandatory twenty percent reduction for each water customer, and in addition to the requirements in Stage 1, the following activities shall be prohibited: (1) Gardening and landscape irrigation utilizing individual sprinklers or sprinkler systems on lawns, gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs, or other plants except as expressly provided for by resolution of the city council. (2) The washing of automobiles, trucks, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other types of mobile equipment except as expressly allowed by the adoption of a resolution by city council. (3) The washing of sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, tennis courts, patios, or other paved areas except as expressly allowed by the adoption of a resolution by city council. (4) The irrigation of turf on street medians with water. (5) The use of water to fill a new or existing swimming pool, spa, pond, or similar recreational basin of water. (6) The operation of any ornamental fountain or other structure making similar or otherwise ornamental use of water outside. (C) Stage 3\u2014Mandatory Compliance\u2014Water Emergency. The intent of Stage 3 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of thirty percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 3 (Mandatory Compliance\u2014Water Emergency)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide demand reduction of thirty percent is necessary. In addition to a mandatory reduction of thirty percent for each water customer, and in addition to the requirements in Stages 1 and 2, the following activities shall be prohibited: (1) Planting any new landscaping, except for native, drought-tolerant species as defined by Chapter 16.22. (D) Stage 4\u2014Mandatory Compliance\u2014Critical Water Emergency. The intent of Stage 4 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of forty percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 4 (Mandatory Compliance\u2014Critical Water Emergency)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide demand reduction of forty percent is necessary. In addition to the mandatory conservation goals for each water customer, and in addition to the requirements in Stages 1, 2, and 3, the following activities shall be prohibited: (1) Residential development unless the developer has submitted a complete building permit application to the city prior to the Stage 4 declaration. Building permit applications may proceed with a deferral of landscape installation, until the water shortage level has been lifted. (2) Linen/towel exchanges more frequently than once every three nights or for the entire stay, whichever is shorter, except for health and safety. (E) Stage 5\u2014Mandatory Compliance\u2014Severe Water Emergency. The intent of Stage 5 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of fifty percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 5 (Mandatory Compliance\u2014Severe Water Emergency)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide demand reduction of fifty percent is necessary. During Stage 5, mandatory water rationing will occur on a property by property basis. Regardless of water consumption in the prior or other base year, the city council may set water allocation amounts based on minimum health and safety standards. In addition to the mandatory conservation goals for each water customer, and in addition to the requirements in Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, the following activities shall be prohibited: (1) The use of water outside of a home or business except as expressly provided for by resolution of the city council. (2) Use of water in excess of the allocation to a property. (F) Stage 6\u2014Mandatory Compliance\u2014Catastrophic Interruption of Water Supplies. The intent of Stage 6 is to achieve an overall system-wide demand reduction of greater than fifty percent. The city council may, by resolution, declare a \"Drought Emergency Stage 6 (Mandatory Compliance\u2014Catastrophic Interruption of Water Supplies)\" upon recommendation by the manager and based on water supply and delivery projections by the maintenance and utilities director, that an overall system-wide demand reduction of greater than fifty percent is necessary. In addition to the mandatory conservation goals for each water customer, and in addition to the requirements in Stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the following activities shall be prohibited: (1) Non-Essential Water Use.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 14.28.082 Best management practices for new development and redevelopment. (A) Prior to and/or during construction, the authorized enforcement official may establish volume and rate of stormwater controls from new developments and redevelopment as may be appropriate to minimize peak flows or total runoff volume, and to mimic the pre-development site hydrology. These controls may include limits on impervious area or provisions for detention and retention of runoff on-site. (B) The authorized enforcement official may require, as a condition of approval, permanent structural controls designed for the removal of sediment and other pollutants and for volume and rate of stormwater controls from the project's added or replaced impervious surfaces. The selection and design of such controls shall be in accordance with criteria established or recommended by federal, state, local agencies, and where required, the BASMAA Post Construction Manual and any issued Technical Bulletins. (C) Stormwater Control Plan Requirements. (1) For each new development and redevelopment project subject to post construction measures requirements, or where required by the nature and extent of a proposed project and where deemed appropriate by the city, applicants shall submit a Stormwater Control Plan (SCP) that meets the criteria in the most recent version of the BASMAA Post Construction Manual. (2) Applicants shall implement the controls identified in the SCP and required by conditions of approval that reduce stormwater pollutant discharges through the construction, operation and maintenance of source control measures, low impact development design, site design measures, stormwater treatment measures and hydromodification management measures. Increases in runoff shall be managed in accordance with the post construction requirements. (3) The SCP is separate and distinct from the ESCP requirements described in Section 14.28.080 . (4) Where projects are required to have a SCP, project applicants shall follow the appropriate SCP template, based on the project type, in the BASMAA Post Construction Manual and any issued Technical Bulletins. (5) Implementation of an approved SCP and submittal of an approved Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan by the applicant shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of a building permit for a project subject to this section . (6) When any work is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter , the authorized enforcement official may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged in doing or causing the work to be done. Such work shall stop until the authorized enforcement official authorizes the work to proceed. This remedy is in addition to and do not supersede or limit any and all other remedies, both civil and criminal provided in the city municipal code. (7) Financial security may be required to ensure that stormwater management facilities operate and are maintained following construction for a period which may be determined by the city. Financial security shall consist of an irrevocable letter of credit, cash deposit, or performance bond as determined by the city. (8) All stormwater management facilities shall be designed in a manner to minimize the need for maintenance and reduce the chances of failure. Design guidelines are outlined in the BASMAA Post Construction Manual and any issued Technical Bulletins. (9) All stormwater management facilities shall be maintained according to the approved Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan. The person(s) or organization(s) responsible for maintenance shall be designated in the plan. Unless a different time period is provided for in the plan, those responsible for maintenance shall inspect the stormwater management facilities at least annually. The Stormwater Facilities Operation and Maintenance Plan shall describe how the maintenance costs will be funded. If the responsible person fails to maintain the stormwater management facilities in accordance with this chapter or the plan, the city may perform the maintenance and recover its costs from the responsible person as provided in Section 14.28.170 . (10) For each new development and redevelopment project subject to the post construction measures requirements, or where deemed appropriate by the city, access by the city to stormwater management facilities for inspections, as provided in Section 14.28.120 , and through such means as may be appropriate, including, but not limited to, legal agreements, recorded covenants or easements, shall be provided by the property owner. (11) All project proponents and their successors, or successors in fee title, in control of a new development and redevelopment project subject to the post construction measures requirements, shall submit one of the following as a condition prior to final inspection and approval of building permit closure: (a) The project proponent's signed statement accepting responsibility for the operations and maintenance of stormwater management facilities until such responsibility is legally transferred to another entity; (b) Written conditions in the sales or lease agreements or deed for the project that requires the buyer or lessee to assume responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the stormwater management facilities until such responsibility is legally transferred to another entity; (c) Written text in project deeds, or conditions, covenants and restrictions for multi-unit residential projects that require the homeowners association or, if there is no association, each individual owner to assume responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facilities until such responsibility is legally transferred to another entity; or (d) Any other legally enforceable agreement or mechanism, such as recordation in the property deed, that assigns the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facilities to the project owner(s).

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 15.04.010 Purpose and findings. (A) Residents of mobilehome parks, unlike apartment residents or residents of other rental properties, are in a unique position in that prior to occupation of a mobilehome space they are required to make substantial investments in a mobilehome residence and incur the expense of placing their mobilehome on the rented mobilehome site. In addition, the removal or relocation of a resident's mobilehome from a given space can be accomplished only at substantial costs, such relocation may cause extensive damage to the mobilehome, and many older mobilehomes cannot, in fact, be relocated to newer mobilehome parks due to permit, landscaping, site preparation requirements, and restrictions that many newer mobilehome parks impose on renters. (B) There is presently within the city a shortage of mobilehome spaces on which there are not currently located mobilehomes and which are therefore available for occupancy. This shortage of empty spaces, which currently approximates one percent of all mobilehome spaces within the city, has resulted in an extreme shortage of decent, safe and sanitary mobilehome housing in the city. (C) Mobilehomes constitute an important source of housing for persons of low and moderate income. Because of the present shortage of empty mobilehome spaces, there is a low vacancy rate and rents are rapidly rising and have been for several years in mobilehome parks in the city, causing concern, anguish and stress to a substantial number of the mobilehome owners and residents of mobilehome parks within the city, many of whom are retired persons on fixed incomes, elderly persons on fixed incomes, or persons with relatively low incomes. (D) Alternative sites for the relocation of mobilehomes within the city and surrounding areas are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces, restrictions on the age, size or style of mobilehomes permitted in many parks, and requirements related to the installation of mobilehomes, including permits, landscaping and site preparation. (E) The result of the conditions identified above has been the creation of a captive audience of mobilehome owners. This in turn has contributed to the creation of a great imbalance in the bargaining positions of the park owners and mobilehome owners in favor of the park owners. (F) Mobilehome owners are property owners with sizable investments in their homes and appurtenances and would incur significant costs in the event of relocation. (G) The continuing possibility of unreasonable space rental increases in mobilehome parks within the city threatens to diminish the value of the investment of the mobilehome owner in his or her mobilehome and contributes to unreasonably suppressed resale rates. Therefore, it is desirable to provide vacancy control in the rent stabilization program. (H) Existing state law permits mobilehome park owners to require mobilehome owners to make modifications to their homes for reasons of aesthetics or conformity to park standards that amount to capital improvements which accrue to the benefit of the park owner by potentially increasing the market value of the park itself. (I) Because of the low vacancy rate, it is necessary to encourage the development of mobilehome parks within the city to the extent permitted by state and local law by exempting newly constructed mobilehome spaces from the provisions of this chapter . (J) It is the purpose of this chapter to protect the owners and occupiers of mobilehomes within the city from unreasonable space rent increases or assessments, while at the same time providing the mobilehome park owners with a just and reasonable rate of return on their property. (K) There is no possibility that the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter will have a significant effect on the environment in that there will be no deviation from the general plan and no change in the present use of property within the city and therefore its enactment is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.

Upon receiving such offer to compromise, the receiving party has seven days to accept the offer by filing a written acceptance with the administrator. (C) Mandatory Mediation. (1) A petition signed by fifty-one percent of the mobilehome spaces affected by a rent increase may request mandatory discussion of disputes under this chapter by filing a written request for dispute resolution within twenty-one days of learning the facts that give rise to the dispute. The request must be filed with the administrator, and provide enough factual information to outline the basic issue or issues being raised. In the petition, the mobilehome residents shall designate an individual to serve as the mobilehome resident representative for the purposes of receipt of all notices, correspondence decisions and findings of fact. Service of notice upon the designated mobilehome resident representative will constitute adequate and sufficient notice of the mobilehome owners who signed the petition. Failure to designate a mobilehome resident representative will render the petition incomplete and the petition will not be accepted for filing. For the purpose of counting petition signatures only, each mobilehome space for which a rent increase was noticed shall count as one unit, regardless of the number of persons living in the mobilehome unit on said space. For the purpose of counting petition signatures only, any person over the age of eighteen living in a given mobilehome may sign a petition on behalf of that mobilehome unit. (2) Within seven days of receiving a written request for dispute resolution, the administrator will notify both the resident representative and park owner that a case has been opened involving all of the spaces affected by the rent increase and will provide a copy of the request to the responding party and a copy of the request shall be received and filed with the city clerk on behalf of the city council. (3) The administrator will not open dispute resolution, or will order dispute resolution closed, when it is clear from the written request that there is no substantial factual basis for the dispute, or when the dispute involves the actions or behavior of persons, or conditions, that are not within the control or responsibility of the parties; or when the dispute is frivolous, malicious or vexatious; or when further proceedings are not, in the sole judgment of the administrator, likely to be productive. Both parties will be notified of the administrator's action and shall have access to the case summary forms used by the administrator, which will not contain any confidential communications from the parties. (4) The administrator will promptly assign the request to a mediation panel who will contact all relevant parties to conciliate and mediate the dispute. The administrator shall have the authority to combine different disputes or different parties in the interest of efficiently addressing the disputes, provided that any party may, for reasons of confidentiality or otherwise, opt out of a combined mediation involving more than one resident or park owner by notifying the administrator. All communications between the administrator and the parties as well as between the mediation panel and the parties shall be confidential and subject to the confidentiality guarantees set forth in California Evidence Code Sections 703.5 and 1115 through 1128 , as they may be amended or superseded. The mediation panel assigned to the case will promptly investigate and if necessary disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest to the parties as soon as the conflict or potential conflict becomes known to a member of the mediation panel. At the time of disclosure, the parties will have the option of waiving any such conflict as long as the waiver is in writing. (5) The mediation panel shall be selected consistent with Section 15.04.020 (Mediation panel) and the city shall bear the cost of the mediation panel. The city may utilize a volunteer mediator, if such person is a qualified mediator under this subsection. The qualified mediator on the mediation panel shall be experienced in the mediation process both in facilitating communications in conciliation between parties and in mediating disputes. The selected qualified mediator is prohibited from also serving as an arbitrator under subsection D of this section . (6) Unless all parties agree in writing to waive the time limit, the initial mediation session will be conducted within twenty-eight days of the date the written request for dispute resolution is filed. The park owner's business location shall be considered so that the mediation will be scheduled at a reasonably convenient time taking into account the distance that the park owner must travel to attend the mediation. If a mediation session is held, the mediation panel shall provide the parties with an opening statement explaining the nature of the process and the ground rules. Thereafter the mediation panel will determine the manner and course of the session, including whether to meet with the parties in caucus, provided that the general guiding principle will always be to provide the parties with a full opportunity to air the concerns giving rise to the dispute. (a) Independent Expert Analysis. (i) The mediation panel, through the administrator, shall arrange for the employment of an independent expert to perform an independent analysis of the application and prepare an independent determination regarding the subject matter of the application. Any expert hired pursuant to this section shall be instructed to give an unbiased analysis. (ii) Cost of Expert. The mediation panel, through the administrator, shall also determine the anticipated cost of employing such expert. The determined cost of the independent expert shall be paid by the park owner to the administrator prior to commencement of the expert's analysis. Any unused portion of the payment collected from the park owner by the administrator shall be refunded to the park owner. (iii) At the conclusion of the independent expert analysis, the mediation panel shall communicate the results of the analysis to the park owner and the residents. The decision rendered through the independent expert analysis shall be utilized as a tool by the mediation panel to assist the parties in negotiations. (7) The parties involved in the dispute, including any resident representative, shall be obligated to personally appear at a mediation session scheduled by a mediation panel. No attorneys are permitted to be utilized in the mediation process. However, a party who is a licensed attorney may represent him or herself. All parties must participate in the mediation session until completion of the mediation panel's opening statement. All parties, including any representative acting on behalf of any resident(s), appearing must have the legal authority to resolve disputes arising under this chapter . Participation in mediation shall be voluntary in all respects after the opening statement. The mediation panel may, with the consent of all parties, schedule additional sessions as needed. (8) Pursuant to Section 15.04.200 , the administrator shall have the power to impose monetary sanctions on any party not appearing in person at a mediation session. (9) No party shall be obligated to reach any specific agreement, or to reach any agreement at all, as a result of participating in conciliation or mediation communications. If an agreement is reached, it will be stated in writing by the mediation panel or by the parties. Any such agreement shall be confidential and will not be enforceable or usable for any purpose outside the dispute resolution process unless all signatories agree that the document can be disclosed or used in other proceedings. (10) In the event the parties do not come to an agreement through mediation, either party may file a petition for arbitration consistent with the procedures set forth in subsection D. In the event the parties do come to an agreement through mediation, a copy of that agreement shall be received and filed with the city clerk on behalf of the city council. (D) Arbitration. (1) If mediation between the park owner and the affected residents pursuant to the mandatory mediation process outlined above in subsection C does not resolve the dispute, the park owner, the affected residents, or their representative(s), may file with the administrator a petition requesting arbitration. Any petition requesting arbitration must comply with the provisions of this section , except that a petition filed by a park owner need not be signed by the affected residents. Pursuant to subsection (E)(3), no petition shall be accepted unless it is accompanied by the requisite number of signatures and is received in the office of the administrator within thirty days of the last session of mandatory mediation. The administrator shall provide a copy of the completed petition to the park owner and the arbitrator. (2) As soon as possible after a petition has been filed with the administrator with respect to mobilehome spaces which are within a single park, the administrator shall, to the extent possible, and consistent with the time limitations provided herein, consolidate requests for arbitration involving similarly situated affected residents who have already participated in mandatory mediation. (3) Upon the filing of petition with the administrator, the rent increase at issue is not effective and may not be collected until and to the extent it is awarded by an arbitrator or until the request for arbitration is abandoned by the affected residents or their representative(s). \"Abandoned\" as used in this section means a failure to actively pursue the necessary steps to prepare the residents' case for the arbitration. (E) Contents of Petition for Arbitration. (1) The administrator shall not accept a petition for arbitration of a rent increase from any resident(s) unless it has been signed by at least fifty-one percent of all affected residents. (a) For the purpose of counting petition signatures only, each mobilehome space for which a rent increase was noticed shall count as one unit, regardless of the number of persons living in the mobilehome unit on said space. (b) For the purpose of counting petition signatures only, any person over the age of eighteen living in a given mobilehome may sign a petition on behalf of that mobilehome unit. (2) The petition for arbitration shall set forth the total number of affected rented spaces in the mobilehome park, and shall identify the name of the resident(s) who occupies each such space. A petition filed by any resident(s) shall state the date upon which the notice of the rent increase was received by the resident(s). A petition filed by a park owner shall state the date upon which the notice of the rent increase was served on the resident(s). Neither a park owner nor any resident(s) may participate in arbitration unless the park owner or resident(s) participated in all portions of mandatory mediation (personally or through a designated representative). (3) In the case of residents filing a petition for arbitration, after obtaining the signature(s) of affected resident(s), the resident representative must personally deliver the petition or mail it by certified mail to the administrator at the following address: City Manager, City of American Canyon, 4381 Broadway St., Suite 201, American Canyon, CA 94503 (or successor address or agency). No resident petition shall be accepted unless it is accompanied by the requisite number of signatures and is received in the office of the administrator within thirty days of the last session of mandatory mediation. The administrator shall provide a copy of the completed petition to the park owner and the arbitrator. (4) In the case of a park owner filing a petition, the park owner must personally deliver the petition or mail it by certified mail to the administrator at the following address: City Manager, City of American Canyon, 4381 Broadway St., Suite 201, American Canyon, CA 94503 (or successor address or agency). No petition shall be accepted unless it is received in the office of the administrator within thirty days of the last session of mandatory mediation. The administrator shall provide a copy of the completed petition to the affected park residents or their representative(s) and the arbitrator. (F) Information Questionnaire. After the administrator has accepted a petition for arbitration, the administrator shall remit to the park owner and petitioning residents or the resident representative an information questionnaire in such form as the administrator may prescribe. The completed information questionnaire must be returned to the administrator at least five business days prior to the date scheduled for hearing of the petition by the arbitrator. The administrator shall provide copies of the completed information questionnaire to the arbitrator, the mobilehome park owner, and the affected residents or the resident representative. (G) Assignment of Arbitrator and Hearing Date/Service of Documents. The administrator shall assign an arbitrator within fifteen business days after receipt of the arbitration petition. Additional documents to be presented at the hearing by either the park owner or the affected resident(s), other than those previously submitted pursuant to Section 15.04.090(B) and (C) or subsection C of this section , shall be served on the other party, the administrator, and the arbitrator at least ten working days before the hearing by mail or in-person delivery. All financial documents submitted must be verified in writing by an auditor or certified public accountant or certified in writing as true and correct under penalty of perjury by the park owner. (H) Arbitration Fees. (1) Once the arbitrator has been selected, the administrator will contact the arbitrator to determine the estimated hearing fee, which shall include an estimate of all fees generated by the arbitrator relative to reviewing submittals by the parties, conducting the hearing, and engaging in any activities related to the determination of whether the proposed special rent increase shall be permitted. The administrator shall notify the park owner in writing of the estimated arbitrator fees no less than fifty days prior to the first date set for the hearing. (2) No later than thirty-five days prior to the first date set for the hearing, the park owner shall submit to the administrator payment in full of the estimated arbitrator fees. If payment is not timely received, the hearing shall be postponed, and the hearing shall not be re-scheduled until such time as payment is received. (3) Upon completion of the hearing and the issuance of a decision, the arbitrator shall submit to the administrator a final invoice for all services. To the extent that the invoice amount exceeds the fees paid by the park owner pursuant to this section , the park owner shall issue payment of the difference to the administrator. In the event that the total fee is less than the original estimate paid by the park owner, such amount will be refunded to the park owner. (4) Except for the refunds provided for in subsection (H)(3) of this section , a park owner may only recover from the affected residents arbitration costs only when an arbitrator's statement of decision, required by subsection (I)(4), specifically awards such costs to the park owner. An arbitrator's statement of decision may award a park owner no more than twenty-five percent of arbitration costs. (5) Commencing no sooner than thirty-five days after the final arbitration award, and subject to the provisions of subsection (H)(4) of this section , the park owner may pass through, as hereinafter described, the arbitration costs awarded to all of the mobilehome residents occupying spaces in the affected park subject to mobilehome rent stabilization under this chapter . The awarded costs shall be prorated by the number of spaces subject to mobilehome rent stabilization under this chapter , and shall further be amortized, interest free, over a period of twelve months. To the extent that a mobilehome is sold prior to payment by the resident of the arbitrator fees described in this section , the purchaser of the mobilehome shall be responsible for any remaining amount. This chapter makes no provision for the recovery of attorney fees and costs by park owners or mobilehome owners with respect to special rent increase hearings or any hearings described in this section , regardless of which party prevails. (I) Arbitration Hearing. (1) The park owner and any affected resident(s) may appear at the hearing and offer oral and documentary evidence. Both the park owner and resident(s) may designate a representative or representatives to appear for them at the hearing. The arbitrator may grant or order one or more continuances to each party for a period to be determined by the arbitrator upon a showing of good cause. A further continuance may be granted if stipulated to by all the parties. The burden of providing that the amount of rent increase is reasonable shall be on the park owner by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. The rules of evidence and manner of producing evidence shall be those rules set forth in California Government Code Section 11513 for the conduct of hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act. These rules may be relaxed at the discretion of the arbitrator in the interests of justice. (2) Any party may have electronic recording equipment or a court reporter present to record and prepare a transcript of the hearing before the arbitrator. Such equipment or reporter shall be provided at that party's own expense. (3) Any jurisdictional or procedural dispute regarding the process set forth herein may be decided by the arbitrator. (4) The arbitrator shall, within fourteen days of the conclusion of the hearing, submit by mail a written statement of decision and the reasons for the decision to the administrator. The administrator shall forthwith mail copies of the decision to the park owner and affected resident(s). (5) The decision of the arbitrator, rendered in accordance with this section , shall be final and binding upon the park owner and all affected residents. The decision of the arbitrator will be subject to the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5 . (6) It is the intent of the city council to have a final decision rendered within one hundred fifty days of the initial notice of the rent increase. The administrator or the arbitrator may, however, modify the time periods set forth in this section at his or her discretion to promote the purposes of this chapter .

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 15.04.120 Standards of review. (A) The arbitrator shall determine whether space rent increases proposed or imposed by the park owner are reasonable based upon the circumstances and all the provisions of this chapter . The arbitrator shall take into consideration that the purpose of this chapter is to permit park owners a just and reasonable return, while protecting residents from unnecessary or unreasonable rent increases. (B) The arbitrator shall not allow more than one rent increase per mobilehome space per twelve-month period, unless a park owner can clearly establish that the rent increase is necessary to cover costs of operation, maintenance, capital improvements or substantial rehabilitation not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice of the preceding rent increase was given. (C) Maintenance of Net Operating Income (\"NOI\"). (1) It shall be presumed that the base year NOI adjusted by seventy-five percent of the increase or decrease in the CPI since the base year yields a fair return. Park owners shall be entitled to maintain and increase their NOI in accordance with this section . The arbitrator shall make a determination of whether the park owner's NOI yields a fair return under this standard. (2) The formula for calculating the fair NOI return shall be as follows: Fair NOI = base year NOI \u00d7 (1 +.75 % change CPI) (3) Except as provided in this section , it shall be presumed that the NOI produced by the park during the base year provided a fair return. (4) Calendar year 2010 shall be established as the base year for purposes of determining whether a park owner's NOI provides a fair return. If a satisfactory base year is, in the arbitrator's opinion, not otherwise available, such as where a park owner did not own the subject property in the base year and/or the 2010 operating expenses are not available, the arbitrator may take evidence of historical factors to construct a base year. (5) The base year CPI shall be the CPI level in June 2010. (6) The percentage change in the CPI shall be calculated by using the CPI as of the month prior to the noticed increase. (7) The comparison NOI year shall be the most recent calendar or fiscal year, unless another period is found by the arbitrator to be more appropriate. (D) New Capital Improvements. A park owner may seek a rent increase based on the cost of a completed new capital improvement (as defined in Section 15.04.020 ), together with a reasonable return upon the capital improvement investment, only if the park owner has: (1) Obtained the written consent of fifty-one percent of the spaces in the park (one vote per space); and (2) Established by written verification or other competent evidence to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the costs of the new capital improvement are factually correct as claimed; and (3) Cost factored and amortized the costs of the capital improvement over the good faith estimate of the remaining life of the improvement, but in no event for a period of less than sixty months; and (4) Allocated the increase among affected residents on a per space basis and separately itemized such increase on the rent bill. Such increases shall not be considered included in the base rent for purposes of the annual permissible rent increases pursuant to Section 15.04.070(A) . (E) Mitigating Factors. In evaluating a space rent increase, the arbitrator should also consider the following factors in addition to any other factors the arbitrator deems relevant in order to determine whether there are any circumstances that may justify a reduction in a proposed rent increase: (1) In the event the park owner reduces or eliminates any housing services, a proportionate share of the cost savings due to such reduction or elimination shall be passed on in the form of a decrease in existing rent or a decrease in the amount of a rent increase otherwise proposed or permitted by this chapter . (2) The physical condition of the mobilehome space or park of which it is a part, including the quantity and quality of maintenance and repairs performed during the preceding twelve months or since the last rent increase. In order to justify the denial or reduction of a rent increase, the arbitrator must find that there are substantial maintenance problems or code violations in the mobilehome space and/or park, and that the owner has had adequate previous notice of these problems and a reasonable opportunity to correct them. If a reduction in the proposed rent increase is justified pursuant to this section , the arbitrator shall make a reasonable effort to quantify the approximate cost of the repairs or maintenance work needed or the amount of the rent increase that would be appropriate after the completion of the repairs or maintenance work, in order to ensure that there is some proportionality between the reduction in the proposed rent increase and the condition of the premises. (F) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no provision of this chapter shall be applied to prohibit the granting of a rent increase that is demonstrated to be necessary to provide a park owner with a fair and reasonable return.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 15.04.150 Operating expenses. (A) For purposes of calculating NOI pursuant to Section 15.04.130 , \"operating expenses\" may include: (1) Real property taxes and assessments; (2) Utility costs to the extent that they represent costs to the park owner which are not passed through to residents of the mobilehome park; (3) Management expenses (including the compensation of administrative personnel, including the value of any mobilehome space offered as part of compensation for such services), reasonable and necessary advertising to ensure occupancy, legal and accounting services as permitted herein, and other managerial expenses. Management expenses are presumed to be not more than five percent gross income, unless established otherwise; (4) In addition to the management expenses listed above, if the park owner performs managerial or maintenance services which are uncompensated, the park owner may include the reasonable value of such services or operating expenses. Park owner performed labor shall be limited to five percent of gross income unless the arbitrator finds that such a limitation would be substantially unfair in a given case. A mobilehome park owner must devote substantially all of the park owner's time, that is, at least forty hours per week, to performing such managerial or maintenance services in order to warrant the full five percent credit as an operating expense. No credit for such services shall be authorized unless a park owner documents the hours utilized in performing such services and the nature of the services provided; (5) Normal repair and maintenance expenses for the grounds and common facilities including, but not limited to, landscaping, cleaning and repair of equipment and facilities; (6) Operating supplies such as janitorial supplies, gardening supplies and stationery; (7) Insurance premiums prorated over the life of the policy; (8) Other taxes, fees, and permits, except as provided in Section 15.04.200 ; (9) Reserves for replacement of long term improvements or facilities, provided that accumulated reserves shall not exceed five percent of gross income; (10) Costs of necessary capital improvements or substantial rehabilitation which exceeds existing reserves for replacement. A necessary capital improvement shall be an improvement required to maintain the common facilities and areas of the mobilehome park in a decent, safe and sanitary condition or to maintain the existing level of mobilehome park amenities and services. In the event that the capital improvement or substantial rehabilitation expenditure is necessitated as the result of an accident, disaster, or other event for which the park owner received insurance or other benefits, only those costs otherwise allowable and exceeding such benefits may be calculated as operating expenses. Expenditures for necessary capital improvements to upgrade existing facilities, together with a reasonable return upon the capital improvement investment made by the park owner, shall be an allowable operating expense only if the park owner has: (a) Consulted with the affected residents prior to initiating construction or implementation of the capital improvement regarding the nature, purpose and estimated cost of the improvement, and (b) Established by written verification or other competent evidence to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the costs of the necessary capital improvements are factually correct as claimed, and (c) Cost-factored and amortized the costs of the improvement over the good faith estimate of the remaining life of the improvement, but in no event for a period of less than sixty months, and (d) Allocated the increase among affected residents on a per space basis and separately itemized such increase on the rent bill. Such increases shall not be considered included in the base rent for purposes of the annual permissible rent increases pursuant to Section 15.04.070(A) ; (11) Increases in interest payments which result from one of the following situations or the equivalent thereof: (a) Refinancing of the outstanding principal owed for the acquisition of a park where such refinancing is mandated by the terms of a financing transaction entered into prior to July 1, 2010, for instance, termination of a loan with a balloon payment, or (b) Increased interest costs incurred as a result of a variable interest rate loan used to finance the acquisition of the park and entered into prior to July 1, 2010. In refinancing, increased interest shall be permitted to be considered as an operating expense only where the park owner can show that the terms of the refinancing were reasonable and consistent with prudent business practices under the circumstances. (B) \"Operating expenses\" shall not include the following: (1) Debt service expenses, except as provided in subsection (A)(11) of this section and as permitted in connection with the computation of costs of a capital improvement or substantial rehabilitation; (2) Depreciation; (3) Any expense for which the park owner is reimbursed; (4) Arbitration fees; or (5) Attorneys' fees and costs (except printing costs and documentation as required by Section 15.04.090 ) incurred in proceedings before an arbitrator or in connection with legal proceedings challenging the decision of an arbitrator or the validity or applicability of this chapter . (C) All operating expenses must be reasonable. Whenever a particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other comparable standard, the park owner shall bear the burden of proving the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that the arbitrator finds any such expense to be unreasonable, the arbitrator shall adjust the expense to reflect the normal industry or other comparable standard.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 15.04.160 Special base year NOI/base rent adjustments. (A) Park owners may obtain a one-time special adjustment to the base year NOI and/or base date rent(s), if the park owner rebuts the presumption that the base year NOI and/or base date rent(s) yielded a fair return. The arbitrator shall not make such a determination unless the arbitrator has first made at least one of the following findings: (1) That the park owner's operating expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to the three years prior to the base year. The average expenses for this period shall be presumed to reflect reasonable average annual expenses and the average of such expenses shall be used to calculate and adjust the base year NOI. In determining whether the park owner's operating expenses were unusually high or low, the arbitrator shall consider whether: (a) The park owner made substantial capital improvements during the base year, which were not reflected in the rent levels on the base date, (b) Substantial repairs were made due to uninsured damage caused by fire, natural disaster or vandalism, (c) Maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services, or (d) Other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding the following of prudent business practice; (2) That the rent was disproportionate due to one of the enumerated factors below: (a) The rent on the base date was exceptionally high or low due to the fact that the rent was not established in an arms-length transaction, or (b) The rent on the base date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the year by reason of premiums being charged or rebates given for reasons unique to particular spaces. (B) If the circumstances specified in subsection (A)(2) of this section are demonstrated, the base date rent shall be adjusted to reflect the rent that would have been received if the base date rent had been set under general market conditions. In making this adjustment, the arbitrator shall utilize the median rent in effect on the base date, or a good faith estimate of such median rent, for comparable spaces within the park or, if necessary, other comparable parks. Comparability shall be judged based on the location of the park, services, amenities provided, and other relevant factors.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 16.02.040 Findings and determination. As permitted in Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7 , the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows: Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors. Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies. Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.

Determining Daily Reference Evapotranspiration, Cooperative Extension University of California, Davis - Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (1987), Publication Leaflet 21426. (B) Water budget calculations shall adhere to the following requirements: (1) The plant factor used shall be from WUCOLS. The plant factor ranges from 0 to 0.3 for low water use plants, from 0.4 to 0.6 for moderate water use plants, and from 0.7 to 1.0 for high water use plants. (2) All water features shall be included in the high water use hydrozone and temporarily irrigated areas shall be included in the low water use hydrozone. (3) All special landscape areas shall be identified and their water use calculated as described below. (4) ETAF for special landscape areas shall not exceed 1.0. (C) Maximum Applied Water Allowance. The maximum applied water allowance shall be calculated using the equation: MAWA = (ETo) (0.62)[(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)] (D) Estimated Total Water Use. The estimated total water use shall be calculated using the equation below. The sum of the estimated total water use calculated for all hydrozones shall not exceed MAWA. Where: ETWU = Estimated Total Water Use per year (gallons) ETo = Reference Evapotranspiration (inches) PF = Plant Factor from WUCOLS (see Section 491) HA = Hydrozone Area [high, medium, and low water use areas] (square feet) SLA = Special Landscape Area (square feet) 0.62 = Conversion Factor IE = Irrigation Efficiency (minimum 0.71) (1) Example ETWU calculation: landscape area is fifty thousand square feet; plant water use type, plant factor, and hydrozone area are shown in the table below. The ETo value is 51.1 inches per year. There are no special landscape areas (recreational area, area permanently and solely dedicated to edible plants, and area irrigated with recycled water) in this example.

The ETWU (1,102,116 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,108,870 gallons per year). In this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA. (2) Example ETWU calculation: total landscape area is fifty thousand square feet, two thousand square feet of which is planted with edible plants. The edible plant area is considered a special landscape area (SLA). The reference evapotranspiration value is 51.1 inches per year. The plant type, plant factor, and hydrozone area are shown in the table below. Hydrozone Plant Water Use Type(s) Plant Factor (PF)* Hydrozone Area (HA) (square feet) PF x HA (square feet) 1 High 0.8 7,000 5,600 2 High 0.7 9,000 6,300 3 Medium 0.5 15,000 7,500 4 Low 0.3 7,000 2,100 5 Low 0.2 10,000 2,000 Sum 23,500 6 SLA 1.0 2,000 2,000 * Plant Factor from WUCOLS ETWU = (51.1)(0.62)(23,500/0.71 + 2,000) = (31.68) (33,099 + 2,000) = 1,111,936 gallons per year Compare ETWU with MAWA. For this example: MAWA = (51.1) (0.62) [(0.7 x 50,000) + (0.3 x 2,000)] = 31.68 x [35,000 + 600] = 31.68 x 35,600 =1,127,808 gallons per year The ETWU (1,111,936 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,127,808 gallons per year). For this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA. (Ord. 2015-05 \u00a7 2, 2015.)

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 16.14.110 Irrigation design plan. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers' recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation package. (A) System. (1) The irrigation system shall be designed to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the manufacturer's recommended pressure range for optimal performance. (a) If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices such as inline pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system. (b) Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be conducted at installation. (2) Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair. (3) Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather conditions are required for all irrigation systems, as appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing weather or during rain. (4) Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. (5) The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non\u00adirrigated areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures. (6) Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation systems. (7) The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the hydrozones of the landscape design plan. (8) The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in Section 16.14.080 regarding the maximum applied water allowance. (9) In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone. (10) Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's recommendations. (11) Sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using the manufacturer's recommendations. (12) Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to high traffic areas. (13) Check valves or anti-drain valves are required for all irrigation systems. (14) Narrow or irregularly shaped areas, including turf, less than eight feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface irrigation or a low volume irrigation system. (15) Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if: (a) The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or (b) The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or (c) The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in subsection (A)(8) of this section . Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the irrigation audit. (16) Slopes greater than twenty-five percent shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with a precipitation rate exceeding three-fourths inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit. (B) Hydrozone. (1) Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use. (2) Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone. (3) Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from shrubs, groundcovers, and turf. (4) Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if the plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for calculations. (5) Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants shall not be permitted. (6) On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan, hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hydrozone Information Table (see City of American Canyon Template Water-Efficient Landscaping Worksheet). This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and programming the controller. (7) The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain: (a) Location and size of separate water meters for landscape; (b) Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads, moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators, and backflow prevention devices; (c) Static water pressure at the point of connection to the public water supply; (d) Flow rate (gallons per minute), application rate (inches per hour), and design operating pressure (pressure per square inch) for each station; (e) Recycled water irrigation systems as specified in Section 19.22.070 ; (f) The following statement: \"I have complied with the criteria of the ordinance and applied them accordingly for the efficient use of water in the irrigation design plan\"; and (g) The signature of a licensed landscape architect, certified irrigation designer, licensed landscape contractor, or any other person authorized to design an irrigation system.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 18.34.010 Statement of purposes. (A) At the present time, there is a critically short supply of rental housing in the city, and, due to the extreme profitability in the current real estate market, of constructing condominiums or converting existing apartment projects to condominiums, stock cooperatives and to community apartment projects for sale, it is anticipated that the number of applications to construct condominiums or to convert existing apartment projects into condominiums, stock cooperatives and to community apartment projects will increase and will adversely impact the availability of existing rental housing and affordable housing units in the city, and will result in the removal of rental housing units and affordable housing units from the market. Tenants who face eviction due to conversion are experiencing serious difficulties in locating comparable replacement rental housing. These difficulties are particularly acute for elderly tenants and those with physical limitations, particularly the handicapped and disabled. In addition, families with minor dependent children face greater relocation difficulties than families without such children. (B) Since the conversion of rental units to condominiums, stock cooperatives, and community apartment projects is a substantial cause of the rental housing and affordable housing shortage, the city council finds and declares that an emergency exists requiring the emergency enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter and it would be just and proper for the subdividers who may enjoy the benefits of such conversions to assist tenants who are displaced by the conversion activity and who otherwise would be forced to bear the burdens of displacement without any assistance.

(ii) This payment shall be made as follows: (A) The entire fee shall be paid to a tenant who is the only tenant in a rental unit, (B) If a rental unit is occupied by two or more tenants, any one of whom is a qualified tenant, then each tenant of the unit shall be paid a pro rata share of the eight thousand dollar fee, (C) If a rental unit is occupied by two or more tenants, none of whom is a qualified tenant, then each tenant of the unit shall be paid a pro rata share of the three thousand two hundred dollar fee. (iii) In no event shall the landlord be liable to pay more than eight thousand dollars to all tenants residing in a unit in which at least one qualified tenant lives, or to pay more than three thousand two hundred dollars to all tenants residing in a unit in which no tenant is a qualified tenant. If a tenant is entitled to monetary relocation benefits pursuant to city administrative agency action or any provision of local, state or federal law, then those benefits shall operate as a credit against any fee required to be paid to the tenant under this chapter . (2) In lieu of the assistance provided for in subsection (A)(1)(a) of this section , the landlord may elect to relocate any tenant into a comparable replacement rental unit satisfactory to the tenant and pay all actual costs of relocating the tenant up to a maximum of eight thousand dollars per household. For the year beginning on this effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and all subsequent years, the fee amounts shall be automatically increased by the cost-of-living increase determined by the United States Labor Department for the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area. The adjusted amount shall be rounded to the nearest fifty-dollar increment. A tenant may not unreasonably withhold approval of a replacement rental unit offered by the landlord. For purposes of this provision only, comparability shall be determined from the following factors: size; price; location; proximity to medical and recreational facilities, parks, community centers, shops, transportation, schools, churches and synagogues; and amenities. (3) In lieu of the assistance provided for in subsection (A)(1)(a) of this section , if the tenant chooses, instead of relocating to a rental unit, to purchase a unit or single-family home in Napa County, the tenant may instead choose to receive the amount of fifteen thousand dollars per household from the landlord towards the relocation and costs associated with the purchase of the new unit or single-family home. For the year beginning on this effective date of said ordinance and all subsequent years, the fee amounts shall be automatically increased by the cost-of-living increase determined by the United States Labor Department for the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area. The adjusted amount shall be rounded to the nearest fifty-dollar increment. (4) In lieu of the assistance provided for in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (A)(3) of this section , all tenants shall have the exclusive right to purchase a converted unit for an amount which is ten percent below the market rate listing price for such unit. The exclusive right to purchase must be exercised within thirty days of the recordation of any final map establishing a community apartment project, condominium or stock cooperative. (B) When Assistance Shall Be Provided. (1) List of Available Rental Units. The landlord shall perform the acts described in subsection (A)(1)(a) of this section for the period beginning on or before the service of the one hundred eighty days' notice of intention to convert, until the date of termination set forth in the notice of termination.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 19.10.050 Lot area, yard setbacks, and building coverage standards. Table 19.10.050 of this section sets forth the minimum lot area, minimum yard setbacks, and lot coverage standards for each residential district. The provisions of this section shall establish the minimum lot area and yard and setback standards for each residential zoning district. (A) Minimum Lot Area. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter , the minimum lot area shall be determined by multiplying the lot width by the lot depth. The lot width shall be the horizontal distance between the side property lines measured at right angles to the depth at a point midway between the front and rear property lines. The lot depth shall be the horizontal distance between the front and rear property lines of a site measured along a line midway between the side property lines. (1) Flag Lots. (a) The area of a flag lot's access corridor shall not be included in determining the site area of the lot (see Figure A-2). (b) The corridor of land which provides access to a street for a flag lot shall have a minimum street frontage of sixteen feet and a minimum width which is less than the required lot width but not less than sixteen feet (see Figure A-2). (2) Width of Residential Corner Lots. The minimum width of corner lots in a residential district shall be a minimum of ten percent greater than the minimum width for the district specified in Table 19.10.050 of this chapter . (3) Depth Adjoining State Highway or Railroad. A lot whose rear lot line abuts a state highway or railroad right-of-way shall have a minimum depth that is at least twenty percent greater than the lot depth standard for the applicable zoning district. (4) Minimum Lot Frontage on a Cul-de-Sac. Unless otherwise approved by the city council in conjunction with the approval of a subdivision map, all lots in the bulb of a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum width or street frontage at the property line of forty feet. (B) General Yard Provisions. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter and specific district regulations, the provisions of this section apply to the placement of principal structures. The location of accessory buildings, equipment, and uses and the required separation between primary buildings is addressed elsewhere in this chapter . (1) Point of Measurement. Except as otherwise provided, required yards shall be measured as the minimum horizontal distance from the appropriate front, side, or rear property line or street/alley right-of-way line of the site to a line parallel thereto on the site (see Figure A-1). (2) Partially-Improved Streets. Where a site abuts a street having only a portion of its required width dedicated or reserved for street purposes, site area and required yards shall be measured from a line drawn on the boundary of the additional width required for street purposes abutting the site. (3) Irregularly-Shaped Lots. On corner lots, through lots, lots with three or more frontages, flag lots, and irregularly-shaped lots where the provisions of this chapter do not clearly establish the location of yards and lot lines, the community development director shall make such determination, using the provisions of this chapter for guidance. (C) Projections into Yards. Projections are permitted into yards required for principal buildings as follows, subject to the provisions of the Uniform Building Code: (1) Eaves and cantilevered roofs may project up to two and one-half feet, provided: (a) That such eaves or cantilevered roofs are not closer than two and one-half feet to any lot or street line. (b) That no portions of such eaves or cantilevered roofs are less than eight feet above grade. (c) That there are no vertical supports or members within the required yard (see Figure A-4). (2) Fireplace structures, buttresses, and wing walls may project up to two and one-half feet, provided: (a) That a minimum five feet is provided on the side yard where front yard access is provided. (b) That such structures shall not be utilized to provide closets or otherwise increase usable floor area. (c) That such fireplace structures are not wider than six feet measured in the general direction of the wall of which it is a part (see Figure A-5). (3) Bay and greenhouse windows may project up to two and one-half feet, provided: (a) That such windows are not closer than two and one-half feet to any lot or street line. (b) That there are no vertical supports or members within the required yard. (4) Uncovered porches, platforms, landings, and decks, including access stairs thereto may project up to three feet into required interior side yards, and up to five feet into required front, rear, and corner side yards, provided: (a) That such projections shall not be closer than two feet to any lot or street line; (b) That such projections are open and unenclosed; provided, however, that an openwork railing not to exceed three and one-half feet in height may be installed; (c) That such projections do not exceed any average height of one foot; (d) That such projections do not extend above the level of the first floor. (5) Awnings and canopies may project up to two and one-half feet into required interior side yards and five feet into required front, rear, and corner side yards, provided: (a) That such awnings or canopies are not closer than two and one-half feet to any lot or street line; (b) That such awnings or canopies have no vertical support within such yard; (c) That such awnings or canopies extend only over the windows or doors to be protected, and for not more than one foot on either side thereof. (6) Covered patios attached to a dwelling unit may project into a required rear yard, provided: (a) That such patio is not closer than five feet to any lot line; (b) That such patio shall remain permanently unenclosed on at least two sides. This provision, however, shall not preclude the placement of detachable screens; (c) A freestanding patio shall be subject to the same requirements as accessory buildings in rear yards as provided by Section 19.10.060 . (7) Rain conductors, downspouts, utility-service risers, shutoff valves, sills, capitals, bases, cornices, and belt courses may project up to one foot into a required yard. (8) Water heaters, water softeners, and utility meters, including service conduits and pipes, enclosed or unenclosed may project up to two and one-half feet into a required interior side or rear yard, provided that such structures or equipment are not closer than two and one-half feet to any lot line. Gas meters, if enclosed or adequately screened from view by a structure permitted in the yard, may project up to two and one-half feet into a required front or corner side yard. (9) Wall and window-mounted air conditioners, coolers, and fans may project into any required yard, provided that such equipment is not closer than two and one-half feet to any lot line. (D) Maximum Building Coverage. The maximum building coverage allowed in each residential district is the percentage of the building site covered by all primary and accessory structures on the site, measured horizontally to the outside face of exterior walls or structural members. Open decks and balconies and open breezeways connecting two buildings are not included in lot coverage.

(1) The requirements of this chapter shall apply to the establishment, alteration, or change in any use or structure, except as may be provided for herein. Parking required by this chapter shall be provided at the time any building or structure is erected or enlarged, or a use is established, changed, or expanded. The word \"use\" shall mean both the type and intensity of the use. (2) When a change in use or expansion in floor area within an existing development increases by twenty percent or more the amount of off-street parking or loading required by the previous use, parking or loading spaces shall be provided for the increased demand. The number of new spaces provided shall be in addition to the number existing prior to the change in use or enlargement, unless the pre-existing number is greater than the number required by this chapter for the previous use, in which case the number in excess of the prescribed minimum may be deducted from the number required to be provided to serve the change in use or enlargement. (3) Required parking spaces shall not be located within any front or side yard setback areas. (4) Except as may be provided for in this chapter , required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land and within three hundred feet of the use they serve. Such distance shall be computed from the nearest point of a structure's public access to the nearest point of the parking area. (5) The planning commission may approve deviations from these standards by use permit. (B) Number of Spaces Required. (1) Except as may be provided for in this chapter , automobile parking spaces shall be provided in the number set forth in Table 19.14.070(B) of this chapter . These requirements shall be considered minimum standards. The decision-making authority for a project may require more parking than is required by Table 19.14.070(B) when it finds that due to the characteristics of a project, the application of the above standards may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. (2) Fractional space requirements of .5 or more shall be counted as the next largest whole space. (3) When two or more uses are located in the same building or structure, or are within the same common development, the parking requirements shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use, except as specifically provided in this chapter . (4) Requirements for uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the decision-making authority for a project, based upon the requirements for comparable uses and upon the particular characteristics of the use. (5) Handicapped parking shall be provided according to the latest standards established by the state of California. (6) No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space other than for company owned vehicles periodically stored for on-site loading.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 19.16.110 Development standards\u2014Single-family subdivisions including those proposing lot sizes smaller than the baseline lot size. The following standards shall be applicable to all single-family residential subdivisions within areas designated single-family or multifamily residential on the general plan land use map unless otherwise noted. The intent of these standards is to provide a measured degree of increased flexibility over standard single-family zoning while establishing compensating or circumstances that would justify greater variation than what would normally be expected. Minimum standards are established to ensure that the basic integrity of the single-family general plan designation is retained and that a range of lot sizes be provided to meet both current and future city housing needs for various home types and market ranges. (A) Baseline Lot Size/Mix of Lot Sizes. The baseline lot size shall be six thousand five hundred square feet. A reasonable proportion of lots proposed within a planned community may be less than the baseline with a minimum lot size of four thousand five hundred square feet. All lot sizes within a planned community may be larger than six thousand five hundred square feet although the reverse in which all lots are less than six thousand five hundred square feet is not permitted. The distribution and ratio of lot sizes shall be based on the following factors: (1) Topographic and other physical constraints; (2) Lot sizes and intensities of surrounding land uses; (3) Proximity to common or public open spaces; (4) Preservation of significant environmental resources; (5) The above standards are not applicable to areas designated multifamily on the general plan land use map where the acceptable minimum lot sizes and mix of lot sizes shall be established under a conceptual master plan and planned community development permit. (B) Exceptions for Extraordinary Features. Exceptions to the lot size and mix limitations under may be considered for significant community facilities or amenities proposed under a conceptual master plan. Significant community facilities include, but are not limited to, an improved public park encompassing an area equal to or larger than park area per population requirement established in the parks and recreation element of the general plan, a recreational facility or day care center serving the proposed community and the community at large, regional trail improvements, or significant contributions (land, facilities, or combination thereof) to school facilities. A determination of any exception pursuant to this section shall be made during review of the conceptual master plan. (C) Lot Width. Lot widths shall be fifty feet or greater but may be less if it can be clearly demonstrated that a lesser lot width will not result in over concentration or minimal separation of structures, excessive garage door width in proportion to overall dwelling width, or reduced articulation of the front entry. (D) Lot Depth. Lot depths shall be ninety feet or greater but may be less if it can be clearly demonstrated that adequate private area is being provided despite lesser lot depth or compensating common open space is provided adjacent to the lots. (E) Lot Design. Lots shall generally be rectangular in shape and reasonably proportioned. The number of abutting lots shall be minimized. (F) Dwelling/Garage Proportion. Garage door width shall not be the dominant architectural feature of the front dwelling elevation. Garage doors shall not occupy more than fifty percent of the width of the front of the dwelling unless it can clearly established that the front entry is clearly defined through use of a porch or similar feature and prominence of the garage door is reduced through use of second story architectural elements above, multiple panel garage doors rather than a single panel or similar measures. (G) Front Setbacks. The minimum front setback from back of sidewalk to the main dwelling is fourteen feet. The minimum setback from the back of sidewalk to face of garage (attached or detached) shall be twenty feet except for side entry garages which may be set back a minimum of fourteen feet. (H) Front Setback Variation. No more than three consecutive dwellings shall contain the same front setback. A minimum variation of five feet is required with the minimum front setback of fourteen feet. (I) Rear Setback. The minimum rear setback is twenty feet. The minimum setback to the top or toe of a manufactured slope with a steepness greater than or equal to 3:1 shall be fifteen feet. The minimum setback for a detached or attached garage (without a second story) is five feet. Reduced setback may be permitted for private yards abutting significant common open space. Reduced setbacks for patio covers, decks or other accessory structures may be established pursuant to special standards under the planned community permit. (J) Side Yard Setbacks. A \"0\" lot line may be permitted on one side if a fifteen foot separation between dwellings is provided on the opposite side. In all other cases, the minimum side yard setback shall be five feet on one side with a minimum ten foot setback on the opposite side. Alternatives may be considered if development plans clearly establish that dwelling separations and viewsheds are enhanced, privacy impacts are minimized, and grading impacts on the adjacent property are no greater than they would be with the standard setbacks. (K) Shared Driveways. Shall be encouraged whenever feasible. (L) Maximum Building Height. Two and one-half stories or thirty feet measured to the midpoint of a hip or gable type roof or the top of a flat roof. (M) Private Open Space. A minimum of five hundred square feet of fenced private yard area is required for each single-family lot. Exceptions may be considered for dwellings abutting common open space areas that are functional for outdoor recreational activities. All dwellings shall have direct access to private yard areas. Private yard areas shall be oriented on the south or west sides of buildings to the greatest extent feasible to ensure penetration of low winter sun angles. Alternatively the fenced yard area shall have adequate dimensions to reduce shading effects of a north building location. (N) Building Elevations. Similar architectural treatment shall be utilized on all sides of a building. Massing of second story elements shall be reduced through use of multiple roof lines, variation of wall planes and incorporation of architectural features such as dormers or multiple gable roof ends. (O) Garage Doors. All garage doors shall be of equal or greater quality to that provided by the roll up variety. Swing up doors are not permitted. (P) Defined Dwelling Entries. All dwelling units shall incorporate architectural elements that clearly define unit entries. All unit entries shall be highly visible and oriented to the street to minimize security problems. (Q) Passive Solar Design. All dwellings shall have sufficient roof overhangs to promote winter heating and summer shading. Main mass of dwellings shall be oriented so as to take advantage of southerly exposures wherever feasible with consideration also given to prevailing southwest wind flows. Attached garages on the south side of dwellings shall be avoided except where no reasonable alternative exists. (R) Common Open Space/Public Facilities. All projects proposing single-family dwelling lots smaller than the baseline minimum lot size shall include additional amenities and open spaces accessible by all project residents to compensate for reduced private yard areas. Open space areas must be large enough to be usable for sports and other outdoor activities. Neighborhoods shall be planned around these features to create community focal points. Size and type of facilities required will be based on project size and location. The open spaces and facilities may be public or private depending on the terms of the planned community development permit. (S) Perimeter Walls. Every effort shall be made to reduce the need for perimeter walls. This may be accomplished through creative grading techniques, street and lot orientation, alternative land uses or residential densities at project perimeters or similar measures. If perimeter walls are unavoidable, a greenbelt of adequate width to minimize visual impacts of perimeter walls shall be provided adjacent to arterial or collector streets. (T) Private Streets. Private streets may be permitted if a homeowners association is established for ongoing maintenance. The minimum standard section for a private street shall include sidewalks on both sides of the street, two travel lanes, and space available on both street sides for parallel parking. More extensive roadway improvements may be required depending on anticipated traffic levels. Alternative sections for private driveways may be considered based on function and location. Parking on both sides of the street may not be required where rear garage access is provided and is deemed consistent with the conceptual master plan.

All planned community conceptual master plan and development permit proposals containing the above development types within a portion or entire project area shall comply with the following standards set forth below: (A) Required Setbacks. Minimum building setback for principal structures on all perimeter property lines shall be twenty feet except for arterial frontages where a minimum of thirty feet shall be provided. Side and rear yard setbacks for accessory structures shall be established under the planned community development permit. All parking areas shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet from arterial frontages. All setback areas shall be fully landscaped; (B) Maximum building height: Two and one-half stories or thirty feet measured to the midpoint of a hip or gable type roof or the top of a flat roof; (C) Minimum separation between buildings containing dwelling units: twenty feet; (D) Common Usable Open Space. A minimum thirty percent of the project area devoted to multifamily uses shall be devoted to usable common open space for passive or active recreational uses. For purposes of meeting this requirement, usable open space areas shall not include public rights-of-way or private streets/driveways; vehicle parking areas; areas adjacent to or between any structures less than fifteen feet apart; private patios or yards; or areas having slopes of 3:1 or steeper. Common open space and recreational amenities shall be centrally located to serve as neighborhood focal points. Wherever possible, open spaces shall be visible from living areas within individual dwelling units to allow convenient supervision of children; (E) Private Open Spaces. Each dwelling unit shall have a defined private open space area (balcony or patio) with minimum dimensions of ten feet by ten feet. These areas shall be fenced or within an enclosed balcony. Private yards abutting a major common open space area shall utilize low (four and one-half feet or less in height) fencing that is architecturally compatible with building design. Other fences shall be a maximum of six feet in height; (F) Building Design. Multiple-family residential structures, including townhouses and condominiums, shall be designed to break up long wall or roof planes by providing defined unit entries, multiple roof lines, offsets in wall planes or similar features.

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 19.23.080 Sign computation. The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height. (A) Height of a Sign. The height of a sign shall be computed by measuring the vertical distance from the midpoint, or average ground level, along the base of the sign structure, excluding any berming, to the highest point of the structure. (B) Maximum Total Wall Sign Area. The maximum total wall sign area allowed for a building or tenant shall be based on the lineal frontage (based on total horizontal width of business, exclusive of any jogs or variation to wall plane) of the business fa\u00e7ade. A portion of this total sign area may be allocated to one or more secondary fa\u00e7ades. If a business faces both Highway 29 and an arterial road, the signage for the wall facing the arterial road may be calculated separately under the wall signage ratio established for businesses without Highway 29 frontage. Figure 19.23.080 Computation Examples (C) Distinct Border or Boundary. For signs with a distinct border or boundary, the sign area shall be computed by multiplying the length times the width of the entire surface within the border, boundary, sign board, or sign face. (D) No Distinct Border or Boundary. For signs with no distinct border or boundary, the sign area shall be calculated by computing the area of a simple rectilinear figure, consisting of not more than eight perpendicular lines, which contains all of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display on such sign. (E) Double-Sided Sign. The sign area of signs which have two identical faces, arranged back to back in parallel planes, shall be computed for one side only provided that the two sign faces are no more than eighteen inches apart. (F) Multiple-Sided Sign. Signs which have more than one side and are not double-sided signs have a sign area as computed for all sides. (G) Including Sign Structure or Support. Where a sign structure, support or other sign feature is designed in such a manner to make the sign more noticeable or appear larger (such as backlighting of an entire awning), as determined by the director or commission, the area of the structure or support shall be included in the sign area.

(1) Ownership projects subject to the provisions of this chapter shall provide a number of inclusionary units equal to at least ten percent of applicable project units (per this chapter ) at prices or rents affordable to lower-income households, unless one of the alternative actions set forth in this chapter is approved. Such inclusionary units may be either ownership units or rental units. (2) Rental projects subject to the provisions of this chapter shall provide a number of inclusionary units equal to at least five percent of applicable project units (per this chapter ) at prices or rents affordable to very low-income households, five percent affordable to low-income households, and five percent to moderate income households unless one of the alternative actions set forth in this chapter is approved. The inclusionary units shall be rental units. (3) In determining the number of inclusionary units to be provided, any decimal fraction of 0.3 or more shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number, and any decimal fraction of less than 0.3 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. (4) Where an even number of inclusionary units are required of a rental housing project, a larger number of units affordable to very low-income households shall be provided (e.g., if the inclusionary requirement equals four units, two shall be affordable to very low-income households and one shall be affordable to a lower-income household and one shall be affordable to a moderate income household). If only one inclusionary unit is required, such unit must be affordable to a very low-income household. (B) Development Standards for Target Units. (1) Inclusionary units should be constructed concurrently with market rate units unless both the city and the developer/applicant agree within the housing agreement to an alternative schedule for development. (2) Inclusionary units shall be evenly distributed throughout the project, except that the decision-making body may waive this requirement if it finds that such distribution is infeasible for one or more of the following reasons: (a) Significant topographic or other constraints exist rendering such distribution infeasible. (b) Substantially improved site design will result from such waiver. (c) Substantially improved building design and an improved unit amenity level will result from such waiver. (d) Significant economic hardships will result from such distribution that does not apply to other projects in the city. (e) Significant economic hardships will result from such distribution for the developer of the inclusionary units receiving financial assistance from federal, state, or local governmental agencies if such waiver is not granted. (3) Where feasible, the number of bedrooms of the inclusionary units should be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the market rate units of the housing development; except that the developer may include a higher proportion of inclusionary units with more bedrooms. (4) The design and appearance of the inclusionary units shall be compatible with the design of the total housing development. (5) The applicant may reduce the size or interior amenities of the inclusionary units as long as there are not significant differences between inclusionary and market rate units visible from the exterior of the dwelling units and the size and design of the dwelling units are reasonably consistent with the market rate units in the project, provided that all dwelling units conform to the requirements of the applicable building and housing codes. (6) Inclusionary units shall comply with all applicable development standards, except those which may be modified as provided by this chapter . (C) Continued Affordability of Ownership Units. Inclusionary units shall remain restricted and affordable to the targeted household(s) for a period of at least fifty-five years, or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. Covenants evidencing these restrictions shall be recorded against the property. (D) Continued Affordability of Rental Units. Inclusionary units shall remain restricted and affordable to the targeted household(s) for a period of at least fifty-five years, or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program.

(2) The premises shall be maintained in a neat and sanitary manner. (3) Reasonable measures shall be taken by the owners of animals subject to these provisions to ensure that noise, odors, flies, vermin and other nuisances related to animal keeping do not negatively impact adjacent properties. (4) If animals are not maintained in compliance with these standards, or are otherwise allowed to become a nuisance, the city shall initiate enforcement proceedings as provided by Chapter 19.02 , Enforcement and Penalties. (B) Permitted Animals. (1) Pets.

(2) Livestock. Large animals, including equines, bovines, sheep, and goats, but excluding swine, may be kept for personal purposes where \"livestock keeping\" is permitted as an accessory use in each underlying zoning district. (3) Other animals, including those of a species normally considered wild, may be kept in any nonresidential zone upon approval of a use permit in each case and provided that adequate space is available and that the animals are confined in a secure enclosure that precludes a risk to the public and that keeping such species of animal is not prohibited by the laws of the State of California or the United States of America. (4) Anyone keeping an animal that is of a species for which a license or permit to keep such animal is required by state or federal law must have the license or permit present upon the property and at a reasonable day and time allow the Code Enforcement Officer of the city to view that license or permit and to verify that the animals are being kept in compliance with any and all conditions of the license or permit. (5) Indemnification and Notification Policy. In conjunction with the furnishing of evidence of compliance with the laws of the State of California or the United States of America, any person keeping an animal subject to this Section 19.31.020(B)(4) shall notify the city of the keeping of such animal and indemnify and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officials, employees and agents in a manner satisfactory as to form and content to the city attorney. (6) Insurance. In addition to the indemnification requirements of Section 19.31.020(B)(5) , any person keeping an animal subject to Section 19.31.020(B)(4) shall maintain at all times during the keeping of such animal an insurance policy from an underwriter acceptable to the city's risk manager and authorized to do business in the State of California naming the city, its elected and appointed officials, employees and agents as additional insures in an amount of not less than one million dollars per occurrence in a manner satisfactory as to form and content to the city attorney. (C) Minimum Lot Size. A minimum lot area of twenty thousand square feet is required for livestock keeping, as defined by Chapter 19.05 , Use Classifications, at least seventy-five percent of which is accessible to and usable by the large animal(s). (D) Setbacks. All buildings and areas used to house or confine nondomestic animals, including barns, stables, lofts, coops, corrals, pens, feed areas, paddocks, uncovered stables and similar enclosures and accessory structures shall be located behind residence on the lot and shall maintain side and setbacks in accordance with the underlying zone district. Additionally, such areas or structures shall maintain a distance of fifty (50) feet from any off-site structure used for human occupancy or habitation. Structures related to the keeping of horses shall be located no closer than fifty (50) feet to any property line, closer than fifty (50) feet to any dwelling on the site, or closer than one hundred feet to any other dwellings. (E) Disclosure. Where development or subdivision of property is proposed to occur adjacent to an area where \"livestock keeping\" is permitted as an accessory use in the underlying zoning district, the deeds of properties included in such development or subdivision shall contain notification of possible livestock keeping on adjacent property. (F) Pre-Existing Animal Keeping. Any property upon which animal keeping existed and was ongoing at the time of adoption of the animal keeping regulations and which did not comply with the minimum lot size or setback standards is considered legal conforming and may continue to exist providing there can be no increase in the number of animals or the amount of nonconformance with setback and lot size requirements.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish necessary and appropriate policies related to conversion of senior housing projects to non-senior housing projects. (Ord. 2009-06 \u00a7 4, 2009.)", "num": "19.34.010", "path": "library|City of American Canyon, Cal., Code|19|2|19.34|19.34.010", "title": "19.34.010 Purpose.", "url": "/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/19.34.010"}

{"body": "City of American Canyon Municipal Code 19.34.020 Findings. (A) California's Unruh Civil Rights Act ( Civil Code Section 51.1 et seq.) expressly allows private parties to establish housing for senior citizens and the Federal Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. Section 3601 et seq.) expressly allows for \"housing for older persons.\" (B) State law encourages \"senior citizen housing developments.\" Specifically, Government Code Section 65915 requires cities to provide \"senior citizen housing developments\" density bonuses for development of such facilities and provide lower parking standards. Therefore, by law, \"senior only\" housing facilities may receive concessions and incentives that non-senior facilities do not receive. (C) On average, senior citizens make less impact on the environment than do non-seniors. Occupancy rates for seniors are significantly less than non-senior occupancy rates. Seniors make substantially fewer trips than non-seniors. Seniors drive fewer vehicles, and therefore require fewer parking spaces per housing unit than do non-seniors. This chapter acknowledges these facts when it applies a lower parking requirement for certain senior housing facilities than would have otherwise applied. (D) Because, on average, senior citizens occupy few persons per dwelling unit than non-senior citizen residents, seniors use substantially less water per household than non-seniors. Therefore, if there is no discretionary process to administer changes from senior to non-senior mobilehome parks, the city's zero water footprint policy will not be applied to such land use changes. This will further jeopardize the city's ability to supply water to its residents in accordance with the fee structure adopted by the city council. (E) Based on the foregoing, newly created or authorized non-senior facilities have a greater impact on the environment than do existing senior facilities. Therefore, the city determines that all conversions, as defined in this chapter , are \"projects\" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21065 . (F) Government Code Section 65595 et seq., permit all of the following developments to pay lower developer fees to schools: developments which qualify as \"senior citizen housing,\" \"multilevel facility for the elderly\" or as a \"residential care facility for the elderly,\" and manufactured homes and mobilehomes in certain communities limited to older persons. (G) Government Code Sections 65595.1 and 65595.2 demonstrate that cities should often disallow these senior housing uses from converting to non-senior housing uses until the full amount of school fees that would have otherwise been required to be paid were, in fact, paid. (H) If a previously approved facility obtained concessions or incentives because it indicated that it would qualify and operate as a senior housing project but subsequently lost its qualifying status, the development facility should mitigate the impacts on the community, including but not limited to offsetting the concessions and incentives previously received. (I) If the city applied reduced public park dedications for senior restricted developments, or lowered fees for vehicular parking, transportation, and/or schooling because the project originally qualified as a senior housing project and then that project later converted to non-senior housing, the public would be harmed to the extent that the converted project did not provide the full amount of mitigation that would have been otherwise required. If a conversion occurs, the city should require that all impacts from the conversion are mitigated. (Ord. 2009-06 \u00a7 4, 2009.)

(2) Prior to issuance of grading or building permits, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating the use of \"Low-VOC\" architectural coatings during project construction. \"Low-VOC\" architectural coatings shall not exceed 50 grams of reactive organic gases (ROG) or VOC per liter of product. (3) Prior to issuing the certificate of occupancy for the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating the use of a truck fleet that complies with the California Air Resources Board's On-Road Heavy-Duty Regulations (Cal. Code Regs., title 13, div. 3, ch. 1, art. 4.5, \u00a7 2025 et seq.) or superseding subsequently-enacted CARB regulations addressing the same subject matter. If the project applicant does not own the truck fleet that would be used during operation of the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation from the truck fleet owner or operator demonstrating that trucks utilized for operation of the project will comply with these requirements. If any change occurs where a new truck fleet is utilized during operation of the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating that the new truck fleet meets or exceeds these requirements. To monitor and ensure that truck fleet complies with the California Air Resources Board's On-Road Heavy-Duty Regulations (Cal. Code Regs., title 13, div. 3, ch. 1, art. 4.5, \u00a7 2025 et seq.) or superseding subsequently-enacted CARB regulations addressing the same subject matter, the fleet operator shall maintain records available to the City upon request.

(5) Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as part of future lease agreements, the project proponent shall provide all future tenants at the project site information on available California Air Resources Board and BAAQMD incentive programs, such as the Carl Moyer Program and the Voucher Incentive Program, that support upgrading truck fleets to clean air technology equipment. (C) Wildlife. (1) Swainson's hawk. (a) The applicant must provide a biological study from a qualified biologist evaluating the project site for the presence of ecologically valuable hawk foraging habitat. The study must include conclusions as to whether any loss of habitat due to the project would create a significant environmental effect requiring mitigation, applying the significance threshold found in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15065, subdivision (a)(1) (whether the project would substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of the hawk). Any significant environmental effect to Swainson's hawk habitat identified in a study prepared by a qualified biologist would be mitigated through off-site preservation of habitat at a 1:1 ratio. A specific strategy for how to achieve such off-site preservation shall be prepared by the qualified biologist and submitted to the City. (b) Pre-construction surveys for Swainson's hawk shall be conducted in the project site vicinity prior to initiation of project construction activities. Agency protocol for conducting nesting surveys for Swainson's hawk requires that three surveys be conducted during the nesting season, with the first one between March 20 and April 5, the second one between April 5 and April 20, and the third one between June 10 to July 30. Surveys shall be conducted each year following initiation of construction if project activities are delayed or discontinued for seven or more days prior to the first required survey period (March 20 to April 5) and are scheduled to recommence during the second survey period or before August 1. These pre-construction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a half-mile radius around all project activities and shall be completed for at least two survey periods immediately prior to commencement of project construction. Surveys shall be conducted in accordance with \"Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley\" issued by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) (then the California Department of Fish and Game) in 2000 (or as updated) to maximize the potential for locating nesting Swainson's hawk and reduce the potential for nest failures due to project activities and/or disturbances. (c) If no nesting Swainson's hawk are found during the first or second required survey period starting March 20 and extending to April 20, then project construction may commence. If during the third surveys (June 10 to July 30) Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting in the project vicinity and construction has commenced, it shall be assumed the Swainson's hawk commenced nesting and thus the Swainson's hawk are habituated to the ambient level of noise and disturbance emanating from the project site. (d) If Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting within 0.25 miles of the project site, a non-disturbance buffer shall be established to keep all construction activities a minimum of 0.25 miles from the nest site. CDFW shall be consulted regarding the adequacy of the buffer established by the qualified Raptor Biologist. At that time the necessity for acquiring a Fish and Game section 2081 Incidental Take Permit (ITP) authorization would be determined. An ITP authorization shall be required if there were a valid concern the project activities would result in the \"take\" of an adult Swainson's hawk, eggs, or nestlings. (e) Surveys and the biological study shall be conducted by a qualified raptor biologist with at least a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science, familiarity with Swainson's hawk and its local ecology, and 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting Swainson's hawk pursuant to \"Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley\" survey protocol. No disturbance such as construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified Raptor Biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on the monitoring of the active nest by a qualified Raptor Biologist. (2) Golden eagle. (a) No more than 30 days prior to the first ground disturbance activity, pre-construction golden eagle nesting surveys shall be conducted in the project vicinity by a qualified raptor biologist. The qualified raptor biologist shall have a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science and at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting golden eagles and its local ecology. Preconstruction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a survey area determined by the qualified raptor biologist, but no less than a 1.0-mile radius around all project activities. (b) If active golden eagle nests are identified within any trees within the survey areas in a 1.0-mile radius of the project site, a qualified raptor biologist shall establish a protection buffer of approximately 1.0 mile that is adequate to ensure noise or activity from the project would not cause nest disturbance of young or adult bird mortality. Buffer zones may vary in size as some golden eagles are more acclimated to disturbance than others. Size of buffer zone may be modified by the qualified raptor biologist considering the type of construction activity that may occur and the behavioral factors and extent that golden eagle may have acclimated to disturbance. (c) No construction or earth moving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young golden eagles have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on monitoring of the active nest by the qualified raptor biologist. (3) Northern harrier and short-eared owl. (a) Prior to ground disturbance, a pre-construction nesting survey shall be conducted for northern harrier and short-eared owl by a qualified raptor biologist if construction is scheduled during the nesting season (February 1 through September 1). The qualified raptor biologist shall have at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting northern harrier and short-eared owl. (b) To determine whether northern harrier or short-eared owl is nesting on-site, a qualified Raptor Biologist(s) shall conduct walking transects through the project site grassland habitat searching for nests within a minimum 500-foot radius from the project site. Where the survey area encroaches onto private property not accessible to the public (e.g., fenced in commercial property, residential backyard, etc., the qualified raptor biologist shall either contact the property owner for permission to physically access the property or conduct a visual survey of adjacent areas by scanning with binoculars or a spotting scope. (c) An active northern harrier or short-eared owl nest must be protected by implementing a minimum 500-foot radius buffer zone around the nest marked with orange construction fencing. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Size of buffer zone could be increased considering the type of construction activity that may occur, physical barriers between the construction site and active next, and the behavioral factors and extent that northern harrier or short-eared owl may have acclimated to disturbance. (d) No construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is otherwise determined to be complete based on monitoring of the active nest by a qualified raptor biologist. (4) Burrowing owl. Prior to any ground disturbance, pre-construction surveys for burrowing owl shall be conducted within a minimum of 150 meters of the project site. Where the survey area encroaches onto private property not accessible to the public (e.g., fenced in commercial property, residential backyard, etc.), the qualified biologist shall either contact the property owner for permission to physically access the property or conduct a visual survey of adjacent areas by scanning with binoculars or a spotting scope. The pre-construction surveys shall be conducted by a qualified biologist following CDFW 2012 staff report survey methods and biologist qualifications to establish the status of burrowing owl on the project site. (a) If burrowing owl are found to occupy the project site during the nonbreeding season (September 1 to January 31), occupied burrows shall be avoided by establishing a no-disturbance buffer zone to a minimum of 100 feet around the burrow. Buffers may be adjusted to address site-specific conditions using the impact assessment approach described in the CDFW 2012 staff report. If a qualified Raptor Biologist determines the location of an occupied burrow(s) may be impacted even with the 100-foot buffer, or the burrow(s) are in location(s) on the project site where a buffer cannot be established without preventing the project from moving forward, then a passive relocation effort may be instituted to relocate the individual(s) out of harm's way pursuant to a Burrowing Owl Exclusion Plan prepared in accordance with the CDFW 2012 staff report. (b) If burrowing owl are found to be present during the breeding season (February 1 to August 31), the proposed project ground-disturbing activities shall follow the CDFW 2012 staff report recommended avoidance protocol whereby occupied burrows shall be avoided with a no-disturbance buffer. (c) If burrowing owls are ultimately found on the site and burrow eviction/relocation of burrowing owls during the non-nesting season is a selected strategy to move forward with the project without direct impacts to burrowing owl individuals, the applicant shall coordinate this effort with CDFW and provide habitat mitigation consistent with the 2012 CDFW Staff Report on burrowing owl. (5) If construction occurs during the breeding season of migratory and resident birds (February 1 to August 31), a qualified Biologist shall conduct a pre-construction breeding bird survey in areas of suitable habitat within 7 days prior to the onset of construction activity. Surveys shall be conducted within the project footprint and 100 feet from the construction limits for nesting passerines, 250 feet from the construction limits for nesting accipiters and a minimum of 500 feet from the construction limits for nesting raptors. If the survey area is found to be absent of nesting birds, no further mitigation would be required. However, if construction activities are delayed by more than 7 days, an additional nesting bird survey shall be performed. If bird nests are found, appropriate buffer zones shall be established around all active nests to protect nesting adults and their young from direct or indirect impacts related to project construction disturbance. Size of buffer zones shall be determined per recommendations of the qualified Biologist based on site conditions and species involved, but typical buffers around active nests are 500 feet for large raptors such as buteos, 250 feet for small raptors such as accipiters, and 100 feet for passerines (songbirds) and other bird species. For special status species, a 0.25-mile shall be established for nesting Swainson's hawk; 1.0 mile for golden eagle; and a 500-foot buffer for nesting tricolored blackbirds. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Buffer zones shall be maintained until it can be documented that either the nest has failed, or the young have fledged. (D) Wetlands. (1) There shall be no net loss of wetlands as a result of the project, as determined by a qualified aquatics resource specialist. Lost wetland functions must be restored through a mitigation process, devised by the qualified aquatics resource specialist, of creating new wetlands or preserving existing wetlands either onsite or offsite and enhancing their functionality prior to the occurrence of impacts to the onsite wetlands. The project applicant shall also obtain any permits for filling wetlands required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the San Francisco Region (San Francisco RWQCB), or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. (2) The project applicant shall submit to the City a jurisdictional delineation and report prepared by a qualified aquatics resource specialist for wetlands subject to jurisdiction of the USACE and/or San Francisco RWQCB identifying temporary and permanent impacts to wetlands resulting from the project and recommending a compensatory mitigation ratio (not less than 1:1) to minimize impacts that cannot be avoided. The mitigation ratio and any other recommendations in the report shall be incorporated into the project plans and all applicable construction-related permits. (3) Prior to issuance of grading permits, the project applicant shall submit to the City a conceptual Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan prepared by a qualified aquatics resource specialist in accordance with Subpart J \u2013 Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources outlined in the State Water Resources Control Board Procedures, and in accordance with the State Water Resources Control Board Implementation Guidance dated April 2020 and in accordance with the USACE Compensatory Mitigation Rule (33 Code of Federal Regulations Part 332). The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall address the loss wetlands impact as a result of the project. (4) Prior to issuance of grading permits, the project applicant shall apply for and obtain a Nationwide Permit from the San Francisco District of the USACE for discharge within wetlands/waters of the United States under Clean Water Act section 404 jurisdiction. For the USACE permit to be valid, the applicant shall apply for and obtain the accompanying Section 401 Water Quality Certification from the San Francisco Bay RWQCB. The applicant shall apply for and obtain a separate Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements from the San Francisco RWQCB for impacts to wetlands/waters of the State. The applicant shall implement the terms of the approved permit(s). (5) Prior to issuance of a grading permit, the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall be submitted to the San Francisco Bay RWQCB for review as part of the process for obtaining a permit from the agency, if one is required. (6) The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall include in irrevocable instrument (e.g., deed restriction or conservation easements) that shall restrict use of created/established wetlands. The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall also include a long-term endowment that would be fully funded by the proposed project to manage any open space preserve and created wetlands in perpetuity. The basic objective of the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is to ensure that project wetland impacts, and compensatory mitigation proposed to offset the wetland impacts, shall provide a no-net-loss of area of wetlands, and wetlands established/created shall be in-kind to the wetlands impacted. In summary, the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall at a minimum: (a) Provide financial assurances to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation shall be successfully completed, in accordance with applicable performance standards. (b) Design ecological performance standards to assess whether the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is achieving the overall objectives, so that it can be objectively evaluated to determine whether it is developing into the desired resource type (vernal pool, seasonal wetland e.g.), and attaining any other applicable metrics such as acres, number of native plant species, water saturation and/or ponding depth etc. (c) Monitor the site for a duration of time determined to be necessary by the qualified aquatics resource specialist, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and/or the San Francisco Regional Quality Control Board to determine whether the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is meeting the performance standards. This monitoring period may be extended if performance standards are not met due to how the wetlands were constructed or natural events such as severe droughts. (d) Protect preserved and created wetlands in perpetuity using an irrevocable instrument (e.g., deed restriction or conservation easement) and provide an endowment sufficient to fund the Long-Term Management Plan. (e) An overall assessment of the condition of the wetlands that shall be permanently impacted by the proposed project shall be conducted using the California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) for depressional wetlands, or a hybrid approach based on CRAM. Each similar wetland type that may be impacted shall be assessed to describe the floristic community and record the native and non-native dominant plants within the vernal pool and palustrine emergent wetlands. Physical structure such as topographic complexity and physical features that may provide habitat for aquatic species (e.g., boulders, woody debris etc.) shall be recorded and used to design the created/established wetlands. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure the design of the wetlands shall provide habitat that is similar to the wetlands being impacted to ensure the impacted wetlands are mitigated in-kind. (E) Cultural Resources. (1) Appropriate buffer zones shall be determined per recommendations of an Archaeologist who meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards (qualified Archaeologist to avoid or minimize disturbance of archaeological resources. (2) An Archaeologist who meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for archaeology shall be present on-site during all earth disturbing activities. If prehistoric or historic-period archaeological resources are encountered, all construction activities within 100 feet of the find shall halt and the City of American Canyon shall be notified. Prehistoric archaeological materials may include obsidian and chert flaked stone tools (e.g., projectile points, knives, scrapers) or toolmaking debris; culturally darkened soil (\"midden\") containing heat-affected rocks, artifacts, or shellfish remains; and stone milling equipment (e.g., mortars, pestles, hand stones, or milling slabs); and battered stone tools, such as hammerstones and pitted stones. Historic- period materials might include stone, concrete, or adobe footings and walls; filled wells or privies; and deposits of metal, glass, and/or ceramic refuse. (3) The Archaeologist shall inspect the findings within 24 hours of discovery. If it is determined the project could damage a historical resource or a unique archaeological resource (as defined pursuant to the CEQA Guidelines), mitigation shall be implemented in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 and Section 15126.4 of the CEQA Guidelines, with a preference for preservation in place. Consistent with Section 15126.4(b)(3), this may be accomplished through planning construction to avoid the resource; incorporating the resource within open space; capping and covering the resource; or deeding the site into a permanent conservation easement. If avoidance is not feasible because it would preclude the construction of important structures or infrastructure or require exorbitant expenditures, as determined by the applicant, a qualified Archaeologist shall prepare and implement a detailed treatment plan. Treatment of unique archaeological resources shall follow the applicable requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 . Treatment for most resources would consist of (but would not be limited to) sample excavation, artifact collection, and site documentation, with the aim to target the recovery of important scientific data contained in the portion(s) of the significant resource to be impacted by the proposed project. The treatment plan shall include provisions for analysis of data in a regional context, reporting of results within a timely manner, curation of artifacts and data at an approved facility, and dissemination of reports to local and State repositories, libraries, and interested professionals. (4) In the event of the accidental discovery or recognition of any human remains, CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5, Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5 , and Public Resources Code Sections 5097.94 and Section 5097.98 shall be followed. If during project construction, there is accidental discovery or recognition of any human remains, the following steps shall be taken: (a) There shall be no further excavation or disturbance within 100 feet of the remains until the County Coroner is contacted to determine whether the remains are Native American and if an investigation of the cause of death is required. If the Coroner determines the remains to be Native American, the Coroner shall contact the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) within 24 hours, and the NAHC shall identify the person or persons it believes to be the Most Likely Descendant (MLD) of the deceased Native American. The MLD may make recommendations to the landowner or the person responsible for the excavation work within 48 hours, for means of treating or disposing of, with appropriate dignity, the human remains, and any associated grave goods as provided in Public Resource Code Section 5097.98. (b) Where the following conditions occur, the landowner or authorized representative shall rebury the Native American human remains and associated grave goods with appropriate dignity either in accordance with the recommendations of the MLD or on the project site in a location not subject to further subsurface disturbance: (i) The NAHC is unable to identify an MLD or the MLD failed to make a recommendation within 48 hours after being notified by the commission. (ii) The descendant identified fails to make a recommendation. (iii) The landowner or authorized representative rejects the recommendation of the descendant, and mediation by the NAHC fails to provide measures acceptable to the landowner. (5) The project applicant must make reasonable efforts to consult with representatives of any California Native American Tribe, as defined in Public Resources Code section 21073 (e.g., the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation), that might be interested in the project site based on the historical homelands of such tribes. The applicant must submit to the City written evidence of such reasonable efforts to conduct such consultation. Where the applicant has successfully engaged with an interested California Native American Tribe and has received input therefrom, the applicant shall offer to allow a tribal monitor representing the interested California Native American Tribe to be present during all project-related ground disturbance. The project applicant shall offer to follow the California Native American Tribe's treatment protocol for Tribal Cultural Resources (TCRs) meeting the definition found in Public Resources Code section 21074 , if such a protocol exists and is made available to the applicant, except where compliance with such a protocol would preclude the construction of important structures or infrastructure or require exorbitant expenditures, as determined by the applicant. (a) Human Remains: Any human remains which are found in conjunction with projects on lands culturally affiliated with a California Native American Tribe that has engaged in consultation with the project application shall be treated in accordance with any applicable and reasonably available Tribal protocol for the disposition or treatment of such remains. (b) Inadvertent Discovery of Native American Human Remains: Whenever Native American human remains are found during the course of a project, the determination of Most Likely Descendant (MLD) under California Public Resources Code Section 5097.98 will be made by the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) upon notification to the NAHC of the discovery of said remains at a project site. If the location of the site and the history and prehistory of the area is culturally affiliated with the Tribe, the NAHC contacts the Tribe; a Tribal member will be designated by the Tribe to consult with the landowner and/or project proponents. (c) Treatment of Native American Remains: In the event that Native American human remains are found during development of a project and a California Native American Tribe or a member of such a Tribe is determined to be MLD, the following provisions shall apply. The Medical Examiner shall immediately be notified, ground-disturbing activities in that location shall cease and the Tribe shall be allowed, pursuant to California Public Resources Code Section 5097.98(a) , to (1) inspect the site of the discovery and (2) make determinations as to how the human remains and grave goods shall be treated and disposed of with appropriate dignity. The Tribe shall complete its inspection and make its MLD recommendation within 48 hours of getting access to the site. The Tribe shall have the final determination as to the disposition and treatment of human remains and grave goods. Said determination may include avoidance of the human remains, reburial on-site, or reburial on tribal or other lands that will not be disturbed in the future. The Tribe may wish to rebury said human remains and grave goods or ceremonial and cultural items on or near the site of their discovery, in an area which will not be subject to future disturbances over a prolonged period of time. Reburial of human remains shall be accomplished in compliance with the California Public Resources Code Sections 5097.98(a) and (b). The term \"human remains\" encompasses more than human bones because the Tribe's traditions call for the burial of associated cultural items with the deceased (funerary objects), and/or the ceremonial burning of Native American human remains, funerary objects, grave goods, and animals. Ashes, soils, and other remnants of these burning ceremonies, as well as associated funerary objects and unassociated funerary objects buried with or found near the Native American remains are to be treated in the same manner as bones or bone fragments that remain intact. (d) Non-Disclosure of Location of Reburials: Unless otherwise required by law, the site of any reburial of Native American human remains shall not be disclosed and will not be governed by public disclosure requirements of the California Public Records Act, California Government Code Section 6250 et seq. The Medical Examiner shall withhold public disclosure of information related to such reburial pursuant to the specific exemption set forth in California Government Code Section 6254(r) . Any involved California Native American Tribe may require that the location for reburial be recorded with the California Historic Resources Inventory System (CHRIS) on a form acceptable to the CHRIS center. The Tribe may also suggest the landowner enter into an agreement regarding the confidentiality of site information that will run with title on the property. (e) Treatment of Cultural Resources: Treatment of all cultural items, including ceremonial items and archaeological items will reflect the religious beliefs, customs, and practices of any California Native American Tribe with whom the project applicant has successfully consulted. All cultural items, including ceremonial items and archaeological items, that may be found at a project site shall, if requested by the Tribe, be turned over to the Tribe for appropriate treatment, unless ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction. The project proponent shall waive any and all claims to ownership of Tribal ceremonial and cultural items, including archaeological items, which may be found on a project site in favor of the Tribe. If any intermediary (for example, an Archaeologist retained by the project proponent) is necessary, said entity or individual shall not possess those items for longer than is reasonably necessary, as determined solely by the Tribe. (f) Inadvertent Discoveries: If additional significant sites or sites not identified as significant in a project environmental review process, but later determined to be significant, are located within a project impact area, such sites will be subjected to further archaeological and cultural significance evaluation by the project proponent, the Lead Agency, and the Tribe to determine whether additional mitigation measures are necessary to treat sites in a culturally appropriate manner consistent with CEQA requirements for mitigation of impacts to cultural resources. If there are human remains present that have been identified as Native American, all work will cease for a period of up to 30 days in accordance with Federal Law. (F) Geology.

The measures identified in the approved report shall be incorporated into the project plans and all applicable construction-related permits. (3) If potential fossils are discovered during project implementation, all earthwork or other types of ground disturbance within 100 feet of the find shall stop immediately until a qualified professional Paleontologist can assess the nature and importance of the find. Based on the scientific value or uniqueness of the find, the Paleontologist shall either record the find and recommend that the applicant allow work to continue or recommend salvage and recovery of the fossil. The Paleontologist shall, if required, propose modifications to the stop-work radius based on the nature of the find, site geology, and the activities occurring on the site. If treatment and salvage is required, recommendations will be consistent with Society of Vertebrate Paleontology guidelines and currently accepted scientific practice.

The requirements of this chapter shall apply to the establishment, alteration, or change in any use or structure, except as may be provided for herein. Parking required by this chapter shall be provided at the time any building or structure is erected or enlarged, or a use is established, changed, or expanded. The word \"use\" shall mean both the type and intensity of the use. 2. When a change in use or expansion in floor area within an existing development increases by twenty percent or more the amount of off-street parking or loading required by the previous use, parking or loading spaces shall be provided for the increased demand. The number of new spaces provided shall be in addition to the number existing prior to the change in use or enlargement, unless the pre-existing number is greater than the number required by this chapter for the previous use, in which case the number in excess of the prescribed minimum may be deducted from the number required to be provided to serve the change in use or enlargement. 3. Required parking spaces shall not be located within any front or side yard setback areas. 4. Except as may be provided for in this chapter , required parking spaces shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land and within three hundred feet of the use they serve.

Except as may be provided for in this chapter , automobile parking spaces shall be provided in the number set forth in Table 19.14.070(B) of this chapter . These requirements shall be considered minimum standards. The decision-making authority for a project may require more parking than is required by Table 19.14.070(B) when it finds that due to the characteristics of a project, the application of the above standards may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots. 2. Fractional space requirements of .5 or more shall be counted as the next largest whole space. 3. When two or more uses are located in the same building or structure, or are within the same common development, the parking requirements shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use, except as specifically provided in this chapter . 4. Requirements for uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the decision-making authority for a project, based upon the requirements for comparable uses and upon the particular characteristics of the use. 5. Handicapped parking shall be provided according to the latest standards established by the state of California. 6. No area may be utilized and counted both as a required parking space and a required loading space other than for company owned vehicles periodically stored for on-site loading.

RR (rural residential) districts: to provide for very low-density residential uses and related activities in existing or proposed large-lot residential neighborhoods, and in the peripheral foothill areas of the city. There are three separate RR districts: 1. RRH (rural residential hillside) districts: requires a minimum lot size of twenty thousand square feet and imposes special development standards. 2. The RR-20000 district requires a minimum lot size of twenty thousand square feet. 3. The RR-10000 district requires a minimum lot size of ten thousand square feet. C. RS (suburban residential) districts: to provide for low-density residential uses and related activities in areas of the city predominated by subdivisions with single-family lot patterns. There are two separate RS districts: 1. The RS-8000 district with a minimum lot size of eight thousand square feet. 2. The RS-6500 district with a minimum lot size of six thousand five hundred square feet. D. RM (medium residential) districts: to accommodate multifamily residential uses in areas of minimal constraints and ready access to transportation and services, with single-family uses allowed under some circumstances in conformance with the general plan. Development in the RM district shall be within the range of five to twelve units per gross acre. E. RH (high residential) districts to provide for high-density multifamily residential uses in areas of minimal constraints and ready access to transportation and services, and to provide a range of housing opportunities.

NOW, THEREFORE THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON DOES HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS: Section 1. Findings to Approve the Specific Plan Amendment in accordance with American Canyon Municipal Code Section 19.17.080 A. The distribution, location and extent of land uses, including open space, as depicted in the specific plan is consistent with the general plan. The Watson Ranch Specific Plan sets forth the land uses, residential densities, non-residential intensities, permitted and conditional uses, development standards, and design guidelines for the WRSP Area and further implements the Policies set forth for the Town Center land use designation. The Watson Ranch Specific Plan is consistent with the General Plan. This Amendment has a corresponding amendment to the General Plan and is therefore consistent. B. The specific plan provides for public infrastructure and services needed to support the land uses described in the plan, including adequate distribution, location, extent and intensity of transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, parks, community facilities and other essential facilities. The Specific Plan does set forth the design for roadways, water, wastewater, recycled water, storm drainage systems, parks and other community facilities necessary to support the land uses described in the plan. Specifically, Chapters 4, 5, 7 and 8 of the WRSP address these facilities. This Amendment is consistent with the provision of these facilities. C. The standards and development criteria, including requirements for resource utilization, will ensure that development proceeds in an orderly fashion and maintains a high level of quality. Chapter 6 of the WRSP sets forth development standards which are supplemented by Design Guidelines in Appendix A. The development standards and design guidelines together promote efficient resource utilization, best practices, and sustainability to ensure a high level of quality. Further Chapter 9, Implementation, sets forth the phasing program to ensure the development proceeds in an orderly fashion. This Amendment does not alter the standards and development criteria set forth in the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent. D. The specific plan contains implementation measures, including financing programs, to ensure that development is supported by adequate infrastructure as it occurs. WRSP Chapter 9, Implementation, sets forth the financing principles and policies, identifies different financing mechanisms, and sets forth phasing of supporting infrastructure. This Amendment supports the provisions of the Development Agreement which, consistent with the Specific plan, provides further clarity on financing and phasing of infrastructure. Therefore, this Amendment does not materially alter the implementation plan set forth in the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent. E. The site is suitable for the type and intensity of development proposed. As determined through the initial existing conditions analysis and the preparation of the WRSP Final EIR, the WRSP site is suitable for the type and intensity of the proposed development associated with this Amendment. The Amendment does not alter the type and intensity of development proposal and is therefore consistent. F. The flexibility in development standards afforded by the specific plan process has resulted in a project providing more superior design and amenities than would occur under more traditional zoning practices, and the project provides clear and substantial benefit to the city. The WRSP Project implements the General Plan for the Town Center land use designation, consistent with Objective 1.19 of the General Plan: \"Provide for the development of a Town Center that physically and functionally serves as the symbolic and identifiable focus of community activities and events for the City of American Canyon and which is a regional destination within Napa Valley.\" General Plan Policy 1.19.7 designated that the land uses in this area be developed pursuant to one or more specific plans. The WRSP includes Development Standards and Design Guidelines that promote diverse neighborhood design and integrated housing types. It further provides for the creation of a \"Town Center\" through the renovation of the cement factory ruins while preserving the unique character of this site feature. This Amendment does not alter the flexibility in development standards, the superior design or amenities of the Specific Plan and is therefore consistent. Section 2. Based on the findings described above, the City Council of the City of American Canyon hereby amends the Watson Ranch Specific Plan as depicted in Exhibit A to this Ordinance. Section 3. CEQA FINDINGS: Regarding Environmental Review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) 1. This Specific Plan Amendment does not change the total number of dwelling units and commercial square footage established by the WRSP. Therefore, the environmental impacts of the WRSP Project which included the Specific Plan were adequately considered in the certified Final ElR for the Watson Ranch Specific Plan Project (SCN. 2015022030) which includes findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Project, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program. 2. Approval of the Specific Plan Amendment based on the Final EIR, the Statement of Overriding Considerations for the Project, and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program complies with CEQA. Section 4. Effective Date. This ordinance shall become effective effect 30 days after its final passage pursuant to Government Code section 36937 . Section 5. Severability. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and adopted this Ordinance and each section, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid or unconstitutional. Section 6. Custodian of Records.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AMENDING TITLE 9 OF CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON MUNICIPAL CODE TO ADD CHAPTER 8.19 SAFE FIREARM STORAGE WHEREAS, the City of American Canyon (\"City\") does not presently regulate firearm storage within residential locations; WHEREAS, firearm injuries have a significant adverse public health and safety impact nationally, regionally, and locally; WHEREAS, improperly stored firearms may result in accidental firearm injuries and/or deaths, particularly in homes with children; WHEREAS, in California, numerous people die each year from injuries related to firearms, and many more are hospitalized for non-fatal gunshot wounds; WHEREAS, having a loaded or unlocked firearm in the home has been associated with an increased risk of firearm-related injury and death, as well as theft of the firearm; WHEREAS, a firearm stored while loaded or unlocked increases the risk of an accidental shooting; WHEREAS, quick access to a loaded firearm heightens the risk that a person's impulsive decision to commit suicide may be carried out without reflection or seeking help, and that the impulsive attempt will be fatal; WHEREAS, utilizing gun locks or lock boxes when storing firearms in the home reduces the risk of firearm injury and death, as well as theft; WHEREAS, keeping a firearm locked when it is not being carried ensures that it cannot be accessed or used by others without the owner's knowledge or permission, decreasing the risk that the gun will be used to commit suicide, homicide, or inflict injury, whether intentionally or unintentionally; WHEREAS, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the safe storage of firearms; WHEREAS, both gun control and gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association, endorse the use of locking devices when storing firearms to ensure that unauthorized and untrained persons cannot access firearms to inflict injury or cause death; WHEREAS, requiring stored, unsupervised firearms to be secured with gun locks or in a locked container does not substantially burden the right or ability to use firearms for self-defense in the home; WHEREAS, the proposed locking requirements apply to firearms that are not being legally carried. Legal firearm owners and adults over 18 may still carry loaded and unlocked firearms in their home at any time consistent with applicable law. The safe storage requirements also permit legal owners to store their firearms fully loaded consistent with applicable law if they wish; WHEREAS, firearm security does not preclude quick access. Portable lockboxes with simplex or biometric locks can store loaded handguns such that they are always within easy reach on counters, tables, or nightstands. Such safely stored handguns may be more quickly and easily retrieved for use in self-defense than unlocked handguns hidden away in seldom-used or remote locations; and, WHEREAS, the City Council finds that requiring safe storage of firearms would constitute a sensible safety regulation and would not be unduly burdensome for firearm owners.

AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON AMENDING AMERICAN CANYON MUNICIPAL CODE CHAPTER 9.04 \"NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION\" TO PROHIBIT SMOKING IN ANY UNIT OF A MULTI-UNIT RESIDENCE AND ANY COMMON AREA OF A MULTI-UNIT RESIDENCE IN THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON WHEREAS, numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in nonsmokers. At special risk are elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease); and WHEREAS, health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection, decreased respiratory function, broncho-constriction, and broncho-spasm; and WHEREAS, more than 440,000 people die in the United States from tobacco-related diseases every year, making it the nation's leading cause of preventable death; and WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has found secondhand smoke to be a risk to public health and has classified secondhand smoke as a Group \"A\" carcinogen, the most dangerous class of carcinogen; and WHEREAS, the U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and WHEREAS, just 30 minutes of exposure to secondhand smoke is sufficient to damage blood vessels in a healthy nonsmoker; and WHEREAS, the California Air Resources Board has put secondhand smoke in the same category as the most toxic automotive and industrial air pollutants by categorizing it as a toxic air contaminant for which there is no safe level of exposure; and WHEREAS, secondhand smoke exposure adversely affects fetal growth with elevated risk of low birth weight and increased risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in infants of mothers who smoke; and WHEREAS, in the United States, secondhand smoke is thought to cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths each year; and WHEREAS, secondhand smoke can seep under doorways and through wall cracks; and WHEREAS, the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is to completely eliminate smoking in indoor spaces.

Thus, the City's action is not creating a new land use regulation and it can be seen with certainty that no environmental impacts will result from the City's action. Consequently, and in accordance with CEQA Section 21084(a) and both Section 15002(i)(1) \u2013 lack of Local Jurisdictional Discretion \u2013 and Section 15061(b)(3) \u2013 General Rule of Exemption \u2013 of the CEQA Guidelines, the ordinance adoption is exempt from CEQA review and a Notice of Exemption has been prepared for this proposed amendment. Section 4. Effective Date. This ordinance shall become effective effect 30 days after its final passage pursuant to Government Code section 36937. Section 5. Severability. If any section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have passed this Ordinance and adopted this Ordinance and each section, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases be declared invalid or unconstitutional.

Only new and amended code is presented below. Chapter 16.02 - CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE Section 16.02.010. Title. This chapter shall be cited as the California Building Code of the city and any reference in the city municipal code or any chapter thereof to the California Building Code applies to this chapter. (Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.020. Code adoption. The city of American Canyon does hereby adopt all those certain documents marked and designated, as \"California Building Code, 2022 Edition,\" published and copyrighted by the International Code Council. The documents identified in this section are adopted in their entirety excepting additions, revisions and omissions listed in Sections 16.02.030 through 16.02.260 of this chapter. A copy of the adopted California Building Code shall be kept on file in the office of the building official for use and examination by members of the public. (Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.030. Appendices. The Building Code as adopted by Section 16.02.020 is amended and adopted with the following appendices: Appendix Chapter C, Group U \u2013 Agricultural Buildings Appendix Chapter F, Rodent Proofing Appendix Chapter G, Flood Resistant Construction Appendix Chapter H, Signs Appendix Chapter I, Patio Covers Appendix Chapter J, Grading Appendix Chapter O, Emergency Housing (Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.040. Findings and determination. As permitted in Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows: Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors. Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies. Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors. (Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.060. Amend Section 101.4.1 Gas. Section 101.4.1 first sentence is amended to read as follows: 101.4.1 Gas.

The remainder of the paragraph is retained as published. (Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.070. Amend Section 105.2 exception 1 Work exempt from permit. Section 105.2 exception 1 is hereby deleted and amended to read as follows: 1. One-story detached accessory structures used as tool and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the floor area does not exceed 120 square feet. It is permissible for these structures to be regulated by Section 337 despite exemption from permit when they provide habitable living space. Section 16.02.080. Amend Section 105.5 Expiration. Section 105.5 is hereby deleted and amended to read as follows: Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within twelve (12) months from the date of such permit, or if the building, structure, equipment or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days. Before such work can recommence, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the recommence fee shall be one half the amount required for a new permit (i.e. building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical fees only) for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work, and provided further such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. To renew a permit after expiration for over one year, the permittee shall pay new full permit fee. The maximum life of any permit is three (3) years. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time frame required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days on written request by the permittee showing circumstances beyond the control of the permittee that prevented action from being taken. Section 16.02.090. Amend Section 107.1.2 Electric vehicle charging stations. Section 107.1.2 of Chapter 1 of Division II of the California Building Code is hereby added to read: 107.1.2 Electric vehicle charging stations.

(Ord. 2019-02 \u00a7 1, 2019) Section 16.02.095. Amend Section 202 General definitions. Section 202 of Chapter 2 of the California Building Code is hereby amended to add or modify the following definitions to read: City of American Canyon Electric Vehicle Charging Station Expedited/Streamlined Permitting Process.

(Ord. 2019-12 \u00a7 2016-12 \u00a7 2, 2016) Section 16.02.110. Amend Section 109.4 Work commencing before permit issuance. Section 109.4 is deleted and replaced as follows: 109.4 Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits shall be subject to a fee established by the Building Official that shall be in addition to the required permit fees. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The investigation fee shall not exceed five times the permit fee required by this code. The minimum investigation fee set forth in the fee schedule adopted by this jurisdiction or a lesser fee than the fee resolution may be permitted on the merits of each individual case by the Building Official. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this code nor from any penalty prescribed by law.

Exhibit B Section 16.02.040. Findings and determination. As permitted in Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows: Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors. Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies. Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.

Section 1. FINDINGS. Based on the following evidence and as required by Zoning Ordinance Section 19.48.040 C, the City Council finds that: a. The amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan. General Plan Opportunities and Constraints #15 states that c limate change impacts pose an immediate and growing threat to California's economy, environment, and public health. The effects of climate change in American Canyon include increased temperatures, decreased air quality, reduced precipitation, flooding, a prolonged wildfire seasons and firestorms, mudslides, severe droughts, reduced water supply, property destruction, and damage to infrastructure. To address these constraints, the proposed ordinance will fulfill related General Plan Policy 1.37.2 which states: \"Recognizing that the transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in American Canyon and in California more broadly, prohibit construction of new fossil-fuel stations in American Canyon.\" The proposed Ordinance would achieve Policy 1.37.2 by prohibiting new fossil fuel stations in American Canyon. The proposed ordinance includes reasonable measures to address nonconforming gas stations and unforeseen \"Force Majeure\" events that cause a gap in gas station operations. b. The amendment is consistent with the purposes of this title, as set forth in Chapter 19.01, Authority, Purposes and Effects of the Zoning Ordinance. The amendment is consistent with the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance to protect and promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, prosperity, and general welfare consistent with the City Council Climate Change Emergency Proclamation that acknowledges climate change caused by human activity represents a growing danger to human health, safety, and economic prosperity, and commits to a goal of net zero climate pollution, measured in terms of net contribution to excess trapped heat, by or before 2030 by implementing immediate and sustained actions in support of its achievement.

Section 19.51.060. Standard Conditions of Approval. Approval of a ministerial permit pursuant to this Chapter (19.54) does not preclude imposition of the objective standard conditions of approval set forth in this section. These include objective process requirements related to issuance of a building permit. Any further approvals, such as demolition, grading, and building permits shall be issued on a ministerial basis subject to the objective standards set forth herein, compliance with which shall be required as conditions of approval included in the Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Warehouse Design Permit approved by the City pursuant to this chapter (19.54) . The conditions of this permit shall be printed on the first sheet of each plan set submitted for a building or other ministerial permit pursuant to this Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Warehouse Design Permit. This permit will be enforced pursuant to Chapter 19.02 . (A) Lighting. Prior to issuance of building permits for the project, the project applicant shall prepare and submit a photometric plan to the City of American Canyon for review and approval. The proposed plan shall demonstrate that all exterior light fixtures would be directed downward or employ full cut-off fixtures to minimize light spillage and avoid interference with aviation operations at the Napa County Airport. The approved plan shall be incorporated into the project. (B) Air quality. (1) The following best management practices (BMPs), as recommended by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), shall be included in the design of the project and project approval documents, and shall be implemented during construction. a. All active construction areas shall be watered at least two times per day. b.

Clear signage regarding idling restrictions shall be provided for construction workers at all access points. g. All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in accordance with manufacturer specifications. All equipment shall be checked by a certified mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition prior to operation. h. The prime construction contractor shall post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact regarding dust complaints. The City and the construction contractor shall take corrective action within 48 hours. The BAAQMD phone number shall be visible to ensure compliance with applicable regulations. (2) Prior to issuance of grading or building permits, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating the use of \"Low-VOC\" architectural coatings during project construction. \"Low-VOC\" architectural coatings shall not exceed 50 grams of reactive organic gases (ROG) or VOC per liter of product. (3) Prior to issuing the certificate of occupancy for the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating the use of a truck fleet that complies with the California Air Resources Board's On-Road Heavy-Duty Regulations (Cal. Code Regs., title 13, div. 3, ch. 1, art. 4.5, \u00a7 2025 et seq.) or superseding subsequently-enacted CARB regulations addressing the same subject matter. If the project applicant does not own the truck fleet that would be used during operation of the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation from the truck fleet owner or operator demonstrating that trucks utilized for operation of the project will comply with these requirements. If any change occurs where a new truck fleet is utilized during operation of the project, the project applicant shall provide the City with documentation demonstrating that the new truck fleet meets or exceeds these requirements. To monitor and ensure that truck fleet complies with the California Air Resources Board's On-Road Heavy-Duty Regulations (Cal. Code Regs., title 13, div. 3, ch. 1, art. 4.5, \u00a7 2025 et seq.) or superseding subsequently-enacted CARB regulations addressing the same subject matter, the fleet operator shall maintain records available to the City upon request. Alternatively, the City may require periodic reporting and provision of written records by operators and conduct regular inspections of the records. (4) Prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy for a building with dock doors, signage shall be posted identifying idling restrictions and contact information to report violations to the building manager. (5) Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, as part of future lease agreements, the project proponent shall provide all future tenants at the project site information on available California Air Resources Board and BAAQMD incentive programs, such as the Carl Moyer Program and the Voucher Incentive Program, that support upgrading truck fleets to clean air technology equipment. (C) Wildlife. (1) Swainson's hawk. a. The applicant must provide a biological study from a qualified biologist evaluating the project site for the presence of ecologically valuable hawk foraging habitat. The study must include conclusions as to whether any loss of habitat due to the project would create a significant environmental effect requiring mitigation, applying the significance threshold found in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15065, subdivision (a)(1) (whether the project would substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of the hawk). Any significant environmental effect to Swainson's hawk habitat identified in a study prepared by a qualified biologist would be mitigated through off-site preservation of habitat at a 1:1 ratio. A specific strategy for how to achieve such off-site preservation shall be prepared by the qualified biologist and submitted to the City. b. Pre-construction surveys for Swainson's hawk shall be conducted in the project site vicinity prior to initiation of project construction activities. Agency protocol for conducting nesting surveys for Swainson's hawk requires that three surveys be conducted during the nesting season, with the first one between March 20 and April 5, the second one between April 5 and April 20, and the third one between June 10 to July 30. Surveys shall be conducted each year following initiation of construction if project activities are delayed or discontinued for seven or more days prior to the first required survey period (March 20 to April 5) and are scheduled to recommence during the second survey period or before August 1. These pre-construction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a half-mile radius around all project activities and shall be completed for at least two survey periods immediately prior to commencement of project construction. Surveys shall be conducted in accordance with \"Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley\" issued by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) (then the California Department of Fish and Game) in 2000 (or as updated) to maximize the potential for locating nesting Swainson's hawk and reduce the potential for nest failures due to project activities and/or disturbances. c. If no nesting Swainson's hawk are found during the first or second required survey period starting March 20 and extending to April 20, then project construction may commence. If during the third surveys (June 10 to July 30) Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting in the project vicinity and construction has commenced, it shall be assumed the Swainson's hawk commenced nesting and thus the Swainson's hawk are habituated to the ambient level of noise and disturbance emanating from the project site. d. If Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting within 0.25 miles of the project site, a non-disturbance buffer shall be established to keep all construction activities a minimum of 0.25 miles from the nest site. CDFW shall be consulted regarding the adequacy of the buffer established by the qualified Raptor Biologist. At that time the necessity for acquiring a Fish and Game section 2081 Incidental Take Permit (ITP) authorization would be determined. An ITP authorization shall be required if there were a valid concern the project activities would result in the \"take\" of an adult Swainson's hawk, eggs, or nestlings. e. Surveys and the biological study shall be conducted by a qualified raptor biologist with at least a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science, familiarity with Swainson's hawk and its local ecology, and 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting Swainson's hawk pursuant to \"Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley\" survey protocol. No disturbance such as construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified Raptor Biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on the monitoring of the active nest by a qualified Raptor Biologist. (2) Golden eagle. a. No more than 30 days prior to the first ground disturbance activity, pre-construction golden eagle nesting surveys shall be conducted in the project vicinity by a qualified raptor biologist. The qualified raptor biologist shall have a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science and at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting golden eagles and its local ecology. Preconstruction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a survey area determined by the qualified raptor biologist, but no less than a 1.0-mile radius around all project activities. b. If active golden eagle nests are identified within any trees within the survey areas in a 1.0-mile radius of the project site, a qualified raptor biologist shall establish a protection buffer of approximately 1.0 mile that is adequate to ensure noise or activity from the project would not cause nest disturbance of young or adult bird mortality. Buffer zones may vary in size as some golden eagles are more acclimated to disturbance than others. Size of buffer zone may be modified by the qualified raptor biologist considering the type of construction activity that may occur and the behavioral factors and extent that golden eagle may have acclimated to disturbance. c. No construction or earth moving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young golden eagles have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on monitoring of the active nest by the qualified raptor biologist. (3) Northern harrier and short-eared owl. a. Prior to ground disturbance, a pre-construction nesting survey shall be conducted for northern harrier and short-eared owl by a qualified raptor biologist if construction is scheduled during the nesting season (February 1 through September 1). The qualified raptor biologist shall have at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting northern harrier and short-eared owl. b. To determine whether northern harrier or short-eared owl is nesting on-site, a qualified Raptor Biologist(s) shall conduct walking transects through the project site grassland habitat searching for nests within a minimum 500-foot radius from the project site. Where the survey area encroaches onto private property not accessible to the public (e.g., fenced in commercial property, residential backyard, etc., the qualified raptor biologist shall either contact the property owner for permission to physically access the property or conduct a visual survey of adjacent areas by scanning with binoculars or a spotting scope. c. An active northern harrier or short-eared owl nest must be protected by implementing a minimum 500-foot radius buffer zone around the nest marked with orange construction fencing. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Size of buffer zone could be increased considering the type of construction activity that may occur, physical barriers between the construction site and active next, and the behavioral factors and extent that northern harrier or short-eared owl may have acclimated to disturbance. d. No construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is otherwise determined to be complete based on monitoring of the active nest by a qualified raptor biologist. (4) Burrowing owl. Prior to any ground disturbance, pre-construction surveys for burrowing owl shall be conducted within a minimum of 150 meters of the project site. Where the survey area encroaches onto private property not accessible to the public (e.g., fenced in commercial property, residential backyard, etc.), the qualified biologist shall either contact the property owner for permission to physically access the property or conduct a visual survey of adjacent areas by scanning with binoculars or a spotting scope. The pre-construction surveys shall be conducted by a qualified biologist following CDFW 2012 staff report survey methods and biologist qualifications to establish the status of burrowing owl on the project site. a. If burrowing owl are found to occupy the project site during the nonbreeding season (September 1 to January 31), occupied burrows shall be avoided by establishing a no-disturbance buffer zone to a minimum of 100 feet around the burrow. Buffers may be adjusted to address site-specific conditions using the impact assessment approach described in the CDFW 2012 staff report. If a qualified Raptor Biologist determines the location of an occupied burrow(s) may be impacted even with the 100-foot buffer, or the burrow(s) are in location(s) on the project site where a buffer cannot be established without preventing the project from moving forward, then a passive relocation effort may be instituted to relocate the individual(s) out of harm's way pursuant to a Burrowing Owl Exclusion Plan prepared in accordance with the CDFW 2012 staff report. b. If burrowing owl are found to be present during the breeding season (February 1 to August 31), the proposed project ground-disturbing activities shall follow the CDFW 2012 staff report recommended avoidance protocol whereby occupied burrows shall be avoided with a no-disturbance buffer. c. If burrowing owls are ultimately found on the site and burrow eviction/relocation of burrowing owls during the non-nesting season is a selected strategy to move forward with the project without direct impacts to burrowing owl individuals, the applicant shall coordinate this effort with CDFW and provide habitat mitigation consistent with the 2012 CDFW Staff Report on burrowing owl. (5) If construction occurs during the breeding season of migratory and resident birds (February 1 to August 31), a qualified Biologist shall conduct a pre-construction breeding bird survey in areas of suitable habitat within 7 days prior to the onset of construction activity. Surveys shall be conducted within the project footprint and 100 feet from the construction limits for nesting passerines, 250 feet from the construction limits for nesting accipiters and a minimum of 500 feet from the construction limits for nesting raptors. If the survey area is found to be absent of nesting birds, no further mitigation would be required. However, if construction activities are delayed by more than 7 days, an additional nesting bird survey shall be performed. If bird nests are found, appropriate buffer zones shall be established around all active nests to protect nesting adults and their young from direct or indirect impacts related to project construction disturbance. Size of buffer zones shall be determined per recommendations of the qualified Biologist based on site conditions and species involved, but typical buffers around active nests are 500 feet for large raptors such as buteos, 250 feet for small raptors such as accipiters, and 100 feet for passerines (songbirds) and other bird species. For special status species, a 0.25-mile shall be established for nesting Swainson's hawk; 1.0 mile for golden eagle; and a 500-foot buffer for nesting tricolored blackbirds. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Buffer zones shall be maintained until it can be documented that either the nest has failed, or the young have fledged. (D) Wetlands. (1) There shall be no net loss of wetlands as a result of the project, as determined by a qualified aquatics resource specialist. Lost wetland functions must be restored through a mitigation process, devised by the qualified aquatics resource specialist, of creating new wetlands or preserving existing wetlands either onsite or offsite and enhancing their functionality prior to the occurrence of impacts to the onsite wetlands. The project applicant shall also obtain any permits for filling wetlands required by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board for the San Francisco Region (San Francisco RWQCB), or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. (2) The project applicant shall submit to the City a jurisdictional delineation and report prepared by a qualified aquatics resource specialist for wetlands subject to jurisdiction of the USACE and/or San Francisco RWQCB identifying temporary and permanent impacts to wetlands resulting from the project and recommending a compensatory mitigation ratio (not less than 1:1) to minimize impacts that cannot be avoided. The mitigation ratio and any other recommendations in the report shall be incorporated into the project plans and all applicable construction-related permits. (3) Prior to issuance of grading permits, the project applicant shall submit to the City a conceptual Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan prepared by a qualified aquatics resource specialist in accordance with Subpart J \u2013 Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources outlined in the State Water Resources Control Board Procedures, and in accordance with the State Water Resources Control Board Implementation Guidance dated April 2020 and in accordance with the USACE Compensatory Mitigation Rule (33 Code of Federal Regulations Part 332). The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall address the loss wetlands impact as a result of the project. (4) Prior to issuance of grading permits, the project applicant shall apply for and obtain a Nationwide Permit from the San Francisco District of the USACE for discharge within wetlands/waters of the United States under Clean Water Act section 404 jurisdiction. For the USACE permit to be valid, the applicant shall apply for and obtain the accompanying Section 401 Water Quality Certification from the San Francisco Bay RWQCB. The applicant shall apply for and obtain a separate Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements from the San Francisco RWQCB for impacts to wetlands/waters of the State. The applicant shall implement the terms of the approved permit(s). (5) Prior to issuance of a grading permit, the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall be submitted to the San Francisco Bay RWQCB for review as part of the process for obtaining a permit from the agency, if one is required. (6) The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall include in irrevocable instrument (e.g., deed restriction or conservation easements) that shall restrict use of created/established wetlands. The Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall also include a long-term endowment that would be fully funded by the proposed project to manage any open space preserve and created wetlands in perpetuity. The basic objective of the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is to ensure that project wetland impacts, and compensatory mitigation proposed to offset the wetland impacts, shall provide a no-net-loss of area of wetlands, and wetlands established/created shall be in-kind to the wetlands impacted. In summary, the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan shall at a minimum: a. Provide financial assurances to ensure a high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation shall be successfully completed, in accordance with applicable performance standards. b. Design ecological performance standards to assess whether the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is achieving the overall objectives, so that it can be objectively evaluated to determine whether it is developing into the desired resource type (vernal pool, seasonal wetland e.g.), and attaining any other applicable metrics such as acres, number of native plant species, water saturation and/or ponding depth etc. c. Monitor the site for a duration of time determined to be necessary by the qualified aquatics resource specialist, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and/or the San Francisco Regional Quality Control Board to determine whether the Wetland Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is meeting the performance standards. This monitoring period may be extended if performance standards are not met due to how the wetlands were constructed or natural events such as severe droughts. d. Protect preserved and created wetlands in perpetuity using an irrevocable instrument (e.g., deed restriction or conservation easement) and provide an endowment sufficient to fund the Long-Term Management Plan. e. An overall assessment of the condition of the wetlands that shall be permanently impacted by the proposed project shall be conducted using the California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) for depressional wetlands, or a hybrid approach based on CRAM. Each similar wetland type that may be impacted shall be assessed to describe the floristic community and record the native and non-native dominant plants within the vernal pool and palustrine emergent wetlands. Physical structure such as topographic complexity and physical features that may provide habitat for aquatic species (e.g., boulders, woody debris etc.) shall be recorded and used to design the created/established wetlands. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure the design of the wetlands shall provide habitat that is similar to the wetlands being impacted to ensure the impacted wetlands are mitigated in-kind. (E) Cultural Resources. (1) Appropriate buffer zones shall be determined per recommendations of an Archaeologist who meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications Standards (qualified Archaeologist to avoid or minimize disturbance of archaeological resources. (2) An Archaeologist who meets the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for archaeology shall be present on-site during all earth disturbing activities. If prehistoric or historic-period archaeological resources are encountered, all construction activities within 100 feet of the find shall halt and the City of American Canyon shall be notified. Prehistoric archaeological materials may include obsidian and chert flaked stone tools (e.g., projectile points, knives, scrapers) or toolmaking debris; culturally darkened soil (\"midden\") containing heat-affected rocks, artifacts, or shellfish remains; and stone milling equipment (e.g., mortars, pestles, hand stones, or milling slabs); and battered stone tools, such as hammerstones and pitted stones. Historic- period materials might include stone, concrete, or adobe footings and walls; filled wells or privies; and deposits of metal, glass, and/or ceramic refuse. (3) The Archaeologist shall inspect the findings within 24 hours of discovery. If it is determined the project could damage a historical resource or a unique archaeological resource (as defined pursuant to the CEQA Guidelines), mitigation shall be implemented in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 and Section 15126.4 of the CEQA Guidelines, with a preference for preservation in place. Consistent with Section 15126.4(b)(3), this may be accomplished through planning construction to avoid the resource; incorporating the resource within open space; capping and covering the resource; or deeding the site into a permanent conservation easement. If avoidance is not feasible because it would preclude the construction of important structures or infrastructure or require exorbitant expenditures, as determined by the applicant, a qualified Archaeologist shall prepare and implement a detailed treatment plan. Treatment of unique archaeological resources shall follow the applicable requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21083.2 . Treatment for most resources would consist of (but would not be limited to) sample excavation, artifact collection, and site documentation, with the aim to target the recovery of important scientific data contained in the portion(s) of the significant resource to be impacted by the proposed project. The treatment plan shall include provisions for analysis of data in a regional context, reporting of results within a timely manner, curation of artifacts and data at an approved facility, and dissemination of reports to local and State repositories, libraries, and interested professionals. (4) In the event of the accidental discovery or recognition of any human remains, CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5, Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5 , and Public Resources Code Sections 5097.94 and Section 5097.98 shall be followed. If during project construction, there is accidental discovery or recognition of any human remains, the following steps shall be taken: a. There shall be no further excavation or disturbance within 100 feet of the remains until the County Coroner is contacted to determine whether the remains are Native American and if an investigation of the cause of death is required. If the Coroner determines the remains to be Native American, the Coroner shall contact the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) within 24 hours, and the NAHC shall identify the person or persons it believes to be the Most Likely Descendant (MLD) of the deceased Native American. The MLD may make recommendations to the landowner or the person responsible for the excavation work within 48 hours, for means of treating or disposing of, with appropriate dignity, the human remains, and any associated grave goods as provided in Public Resource Code Section 5097.98. b. Where the following conditions occur, the landowner or authorized representative shall rebury the Native American human remains and associated grave goods with appropriate dignity either in accordance with the recommendations of the MLD or on the project site in a location not subject to further subsurface disturbance: i. The NAHC is unable to identify an MLD or the MLD failed to make a recommendation within 48 hours after being notified by the commission. ii. The descendant identified fails to make a recommendation. iii. The landowner or authorized representative rejects the recommendation of the descendant, and mediation by the NAHC fails to provide measures acceptable to the landowner. (5) The project applicant must make reasonable efforts to consult with representatives of any California Native American Tribe, as defined in Public Resources Code section 21073 (e.g., the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation), that might be interested in the project site based on the historical homelands of such tribes. The applicant must submit to the City written evidence of such reasonable efforts to conduct such consultation. Where the applicant has successfully engaged with an interested California Native American Tribe and has received input therefrom, the applicant shall offer to allow a tribal monitor representing the interested California Native American Tribe to be present during all project-related ground disturbance. The project applicant shall offer to follow the California Native American Tribe's treatment protocol for Tribal Cultural Resources (TCRs) meeting the definition found in Public Resources Code section 21074 , if such a protocol exists and is made available to the applicant, except where compliance with such a protocol would preclude the construction of important structures or infrastructure or require exorbitant expenditures, as determined by the applicant. a. Human Remains: Any human remains which are found in conjunction with projects on lands culturally affiliated with a California Native American Tribe that has engaged in consultation with the project application shall be treated in accordance with any applicable and reasonably available Tribal protocol for the disposition or treatment of such remains. b. Inadvertent Discovery of Native American Human Remains: Whenever Native American human remains are found during the course of a project, the determination of Most Likely Descendant (MLD) under California Public Resources Code Section 5097.98 will be made by the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) upon notification to the NAHC of the discovery of said remains at a project site. If the location of the site and the history and prehistory of the area is culturally affiliated with the Tribe, the NAHC contacts the Tribe; a Tribal member will be designated by the Tribe to consult with the landowner and/or project proponents. c. Treatment of Native American Remains: In the event that Native American human remains are found during development of a project and a California Native American Tribe or a member of such a Tribe is determined to be MLD, the following provisions shall apply. The Medical Examiner shall immediately be notified, ground-disturbing activities in that location shall cease and the Tribe shall be allowed, pursuant to California Public Resources Code Section 5097.98(a) , to (1) inspect the site of the discovery and (2) make determinations as to how the human remains and grave goods shall be treated and disposed of with appropriate dignity. The Tribe shall complete its inspection and make its MLD recommendation within 48 hours of getting access to the site. The Tribe shall have the final determination as to the disposition and treatment of human remains and grave goods. Said determination may include avoidance of the human remains, reburial on-site, or reburial on tribal or other lands that will not be disturbed in the future. The Tribe may wish to rebury said human remains and grave goods or ceremonial and cultural items on or near the site of their discovery, in an area which will not be subject to future disturbances over a prolonged period of time. Reburial of human remains shall be accomplished in compliance with the California Public Resources Code Sections 5097.98(a) and (b). The term \"human remains\" encompasses more than human bones because the Tribe's traditions call for the burial of associated cultural items with the deceased (funerary objects), and/or the ceremonial burning of Native American human remains, funerary objects, grave goods, and animals. Ashes, soils, and other remnants of these burning ceremonies, as well as associated funerary objects and unassociated funerary objects buried with or found near the Native American remains are to be treated in the same manner as bones or bone fragments that remain intact. d. Non-Disclosure of Location of Reburials: Unless otherwise required by law, the site of any reburial of Native American human remains shall not be disclosed and will not be governed by public disclosure requirements of the California Public Records Act, California Government Code Section 6250 et seq. The Medical Examiner shall withhold public disclosure of information related to such reburial pursuant to the specific exemption set forth in California Government Code Section 6254(r) . Any involved California Native American Tribe may require that the location for reburial be recorded with the California Historic Resources Inventory System (CHRIS) on a form acceptable to the CHRIS center. The Tribe may also suggest the landowner enter into an agreement regarding the confidentiality of site information that will run with title on the property. e. Treatment of Cultural Resources: Treatment of all cultural items, including ceremonial items and archaeological items will reflect the religious beliefs, customs, and practices of any California Native American Tribe with whom the project applicant has successfully consulted. All cultural items, including ceremonial items and archaeological items, that may be found at a project site shall, if requested by the Tribe, be turned over to the Tribe for appropriate treatment, unless ordered by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction. The project proponent shall waive any and all claims to ownership of Tribal ceremonial and cultural items, including archaeological items, which may be found on a project site in favor of the Tribe. If any intermediary (for example, an Archaeologist retained by the project proponent) is necessary, said entity or individual shall not possess those items for longer than is reasonably necessary, as determined solely by the Tribe. f. Inadvertent Discoveries: If additional significant sites or sites not identified as significant in a project environmental review process, but later determined to be significant, are located within a project impact area, such sites will be subjected to further archaeological and cultural significance evaluation by the project proponent, the Lead Agency, and the Tribe to determine whether additional mitigation measures are necessary to treat sites in a culturally appropriate manner consistent with CEQA requirements for mitigation of impacts to cultural resources. If there are human remains present that have been identified as Native American, all work will cease for a period of up to 30 days in accordance with Federal Law. (F) Geology. (1) Where a project site lies astride, or immediately adjacent to, the West Napa Fault, the project applicant shall, prior to the issuance of any building permits, submit plans to the City of American Canyon that demonstrate a minimum 50-foot setback between the West Napa Fault and each building.

The report shall also determine the final design parameters for walls, foundations, foundation slabs, and surrounding related improvements (e.g., utilities roadways, parking lots, and sidewalks). The measures identified in the approved report shall be incorporated into the project plans and all applicable construction-related permits. (3) If potential fossils are discovered during project implementation, all earthwork or other types of ground disturbance within 100 feet of the find shall stop immediately until a qualified professional Paleontologist can assess the nature and importance of the find. Based on the scientific value or uniqueness of the find, the Paleontologist shall either record the find and recommend that the applicant allow work to continue or recommend salvage and recovery of the fossil. The Paleontologist shall, if required, propose modifications to the stop-work radius based on the nature of the find, site geology, and the activities occurring on the site. If treatment and salvage is required, recommendations will be consistent with Society of Vertebrate Paleontology guidelines and currently accepted scientific practice. If necessary, treatment for fossil remains shall include preparation and recovery of fossil materials so that they can be housed in an appropriate museum or university collection, and, if required, shall also include preparation of a report for publication describing the finds.
