                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(A)">(A)</span> Indemnity Required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from the franchisee. The indemnity must:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(A)(1)">(1)</span> Release the city from and against any and all loss, damage, expense, cost (without limitation the cost of litigation) liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable communications system. Each cable communications system operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in connection with the above-mentioned matters;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(A)(2)">(2)</span> Indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the city, its elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, cost, claims, demands, or causes of action of any kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees sustained by the city or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the cable communications system operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(A)(3)">(3)</span> Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the release, indemnification, and hold harmless provision shall survive the term of the franchise or other authorization and continue in full force and effect as to the party's responsibility to indemnify.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)">(B)</span> Insurance Required. A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall not commence construction or operation of the system without obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type satisfactory to the city. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)">(C)</span> Proof. Certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance and naming the city as an additional insured, and other proofs as the city may find necessary, shall be filed with the city. For persons issued franchises after the effective date of the ordinance codified in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a>, certificates and other required proofs shall be filed within thirty days of the issuance of a franchise, prior to the commencement of construction, once a year thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage. For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a>, the certificate shall be filed within sixty days of the effective date of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a>, annually thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. In the event that the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the term of the franchise, then in that event, the cable communications system operator shall furnish, at least thirty days prior to the expiration of the date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage has been obtained.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)">(D)</span> Certificate Contents. All certificates shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least thirty days' prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state of California. Financial ratings of the insurer shall be no less than "A" VII or better in the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide," published by A.M. Best Guide.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(E)">(E)</span> Insurance Amounts. A cable communications system operator (and those acting on its behalf to construct or operate the system) shall maintain the following minimum insurance. The city shall be named as an additional insured by endorsement on the general liability and automotive policies; those insurance policies shall be primary and contain a cross-liability clause.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)">(F)</span> Construction Bond. Every operator of a cable communications system shall obtain and maintain a construction bond to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a> and any franchise. The amount of the bond shall be set in the city franchise, but shall not be less than ten percent of the estimated cost of constructing or (in the case of existing systems) upgrading the system, and shall include a sufficient amount to cover the removal of facilities and/or restoration of city facilities within the right-of-way. The bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. Bonds must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(G)">(G)</span> Security Fund. Every cable communications system operator shall establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise, and to pay any taxes, fees, penalties or liens owed to the city. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the city. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the cable communications system operator shall, within fourteen days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the city for a franchisee where the city determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee's operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The city may from time to time require a franchisee to change the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed risks to the city and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or other payments to the city. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise.</p>
