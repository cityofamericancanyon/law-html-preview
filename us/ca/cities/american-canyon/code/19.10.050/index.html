                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(E)(1)(a)">(a)</span> Residential lots shall vary significantly in size in order to create the openness and variation characteristic of a rural neighborhood. No more than two contiguous lots shall be of the same size. Lot size variations shall be achieved by varying lot area/lot widths. Parcel size variations on contiguous lots of one acre or less shall vary up or down a minimum of twenty-five percent in size. Contiguous lots larger than one acre shall vary up or down in size by ten percent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(E)(1)(b)">(b)</span> The subdivision design shall ensure protection of designated viewsheds from Newell Drive to the highest ridgeline located to the east of the project.</p>

Technical information that enables identification of a maximum building height will include but not be limited to: lot placement within the subdivision, building envelope placement, and grading. The maximum building height will be recorded in the project CC&amp;Rs (Covenants, Codes and Restrictions).</p>
