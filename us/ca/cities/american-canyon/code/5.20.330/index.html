                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(2)(e)">(e)</span> A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done with existing facilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(3)">(3)</span> Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant has the financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It is not the intent of the city to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposes to offer will succeed in the marketplace;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(4)">(4)</span> Evidence satisfactory to the city that applicant is technically qualified to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum, the applicant must show that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed adequately, and can respond to emergencies during and after construction is complete;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(5)">(5)</span> Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(5)(a)">(a)</span> Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary authorizations from state and federal authorities,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(5)(b)">(b)</span> Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows city to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of franchise, or provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a>,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(5)(c)">(c)</span> Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those relating to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(6)">(6)</span> An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(7)">(7)</span> An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of: the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of open video system facilities;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(B)(8)">(8)</span> To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs should be provided for that person. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state agency of competent jurisdiction; or if applicant is a holder of a franchise in the city for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under such other franchise provides no basis for additional investigation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)">(C)</span> Procedure for Applying for Grant of a Franchise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)">(1)</span> A person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise on its own initiative or in response to a request for proposals. Upon receipt of an application, the city shall promptly proffer the applicant a proposed OVS agreement, which shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available to any other interested party. The city may request such additional information, as it deems appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(2)">(2)</span> An applicant shall respond to requests for information completely, and within the time directed by the city, and must strictly comply with procedures, instructions, and requirements the city may establish.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)">(3)</span> An application may be rejected if it is incomplete or the applicant fails to follow procedures or respond fully to information requests.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)">(D)</span> Evaluation. In evaluating a franchise application, the city may consider the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)(1)">(1)</span> The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing city OVS franchise;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)(2)">(2)</span> Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to hold an OVS franchise;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)(3)">(3)</span> Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city for, or will otherwise provide adequate public, educational, and governmental use capacity, facilities, or financial support (including with respect to institutional networks);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)(4)">(4)</span> Whether issuance of a franchise would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(D)(5)">(5)</span> Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(E)">(E)</span> Issuance. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors above, and such other matters as it is required or entitled to consider, and subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate OVS agreement, it shall issue a franchise. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)">(F)</span> Legal Qualifications. In order to be legally qualified:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(1)">(1)</span> The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20" title="Chapter 5.20 CABLE SYSTEMS AND OPEN VIDEO SYSTEMS">this chapter</a> and applicable laws, and to comply with such requirements of an OVS agreement as the city may lawfully require;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(2)">(2)</span> The applicant must not hold a cable system franchise, or have pending an application for a cable system franchise with the city;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(3)">(3)</span> The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise validly revoked, (including any appeals) by the city within three years preceding the submission of the application;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(4)">(4)</span> The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or renewal cable system franchise to the city denied within three years preceding the submission of the application;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(5)">(5)</span> The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or renewal OVS franchise denied on any grounds within three years of the applications;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(6)">(6)</span> The applicant or its principals shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during the ten years preceding the submission of the application, applicant was convicted or found to have committed fraud, racketeering, securities fraud, anticompetitive actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers or to substantially comply with its obligations;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(7)">(7)</span> Applicant must have the necessary authority under California and federal law to operate an OVS, and must be certified by the FCC under Section 653 of the Cable Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(8)">(8)</span> The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(F)(9)">(9)</span> For purposes of subsection (F)(2) through (5) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20.330" title="5.20.330 Applications for grant or renewal of franchises.">this section</a>, the term applicant includes any affiliate of applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(G)">(G)</span> Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (F) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20.330" title="5.20.330 Applications for grant or renewal of franchises.">this section</a>, an applicant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should issue even if the requirements of subsection (F)(4) and (5) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/5.20.330" title="5.20.330 Applications for grant or renewal of franchises.">this section</a> are not satisfied, by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system.</p>
