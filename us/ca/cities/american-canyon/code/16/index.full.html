                <p>As permitted in <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=17958.7" title="">Health and Safety Code Section 17958.7</a>, the city of American Canyon finds and determines the local amendments to the 2022 California Building Code are either administrative in nature or reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public due to local climatic, geological or topographical conditions. Those findings are as follows:</p>
                <p>Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. The city is located in a climatic zone with precipitation ranging from fifteen to twenty-six inches per year. Ninety-five percent of precipitation falls during the months of November through April, leaving a dry period of approximately six months each year. Relative humidity remains moderate most of the time. High temperatures in the summer average in the mid-eighty degrees Fahrenheit and in the winter in the mid-fifty degrees Fahrenheit. Prevailing winds in the area are common with gusts up to thirty-five miles per hour. These climatic conditions, along with our topography, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</p>
                <p>Express Finding Number 2: Geological. The city is located in Seismic Design Category D, which is indicative of high seismic vulnerability. The West Napa fault is documented to be present in our city. The area includes various soil conditions and areas with significant movement potential. Buildings and other structures in Seismic Design Category D can experience major seismic damage. These geological conditions necessitate the prohibition of gypsum as a lateral-resisting building element, and the restriction of Portland cement plaster as a lateral-resisting building element to one-story structures of R-3 and U-1 occupancies.</p>
                <p>Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. Areas of highly combustible dry grasses, weeds, brush and trees adjacent to structures are common throughout the city. Above-ground electrical power transmission lines are suspended through trees and above large areas of dry vegetation. The arrangement of man-made features around many buildings greatly limits any approach to all but one side of a building. The area immediately adjacent to the eastern border of the city has been classified as high and very high fire severity zones under the Fire and Resource Assessment Program of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. These topographical conditions, along with our climate, necessitate a greater requirement for fire-sprinklers in residential construction, a minimum Class A roof covering and adequate spark arrestors.</p>

                <p>Section 205 is deleted and replaced as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>205.1 General.</strong> In order to hear and decide appeals of orders, decisions or determinations made by the building official relative to the application and interpretation of this code, there shall be and is hereby created a board of appeals. The board of appeals shall be appointed by the City Council and shall hold office at its pleasure. The board shall adopt rules of procedure for conducting its business.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, the City may use five (5) Building Official members of the Napa-Solano Chapter of the International Code Council (NSICC), chosen on a case-by-case basis, to serve as the Board of Appeals for the City of American Canyon. The NSICC, an organization of Building Officials, Building Inspectors, and Construction Industry personnel, was formed in 1978 to help maintain consistent and uniform code enforcement and code interpretation within the jurisdictions of Napa and Solano counties. Building Officials from jurisdictions within Napa and Solano counties and neighboring counties are members of the NSICC.</p>
                <p>Building Official members of the NSICC are well versed in the technical and administrative provisions of construction codes.</p>
                <p><strong>205.2 Limitations of Authority.</strong> The board shall have no authority relative to interpretation of the administrative provisions of this code nor shall the board be empowered to waive requirements of this code. An application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of this code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted, the provisions of this code do not fully apply or an equally good or better form of construction is proposed. Appeals from any findings by the Board of Appeals may be made by the applicant, a member of the City Council or the Building Official upon request in writing to the City Council within ten (10) days from the date of the Board's action.</p>
                <p><strong>205.3 Qualifications.</strong> The board of appeals shall consist of members who are qualified by experience and training to pass on matters pertaining to building construction and are not employees of the jurisdiction.</p>

New structural members and connections required by this rehabilitation design shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.3.1 Lateral Force-Resisting Elements.</strong> Regardless of the level of damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, if substantial structural damage to vertical load-carrying components was caused primarily by wind or seismic effects, then the building shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1 and, if non-compliant, rehabilitated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.3.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.4 Less than Substantial Structural Damage.</strong> For damage less than substantial structural damage, repairs shall be allowed that restore the building to its pre-damage state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage.

                <p>Compare ETWU with MAWA. For this example:</p>
                <p>MAWA = (51.1) (0.62) [(0.7 x 50,000) + (0.3 x 2,000)]</p>
                <p>= 31.68 x [35,000 + 600]</p>
                <p>= 31.68 x 35,600</p>
                <p>=1,127,808 gallons per year</p>
                <p>The ETWU (1,111,936 gallons per year) is less than MAWA (1,127,808 gallons per year). For this example, the water budget complies with the MAWA.</p>
