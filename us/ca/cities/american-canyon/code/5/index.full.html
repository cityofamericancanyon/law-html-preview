                <p>The intent of this chapter is to provide a regulatory framework for permitting special events and temporary outdoor promotions. The use of private property, city streets or other city-owned or controlled property by large groups causes wear and tear on turf, park equipment and facilities, and requires city staff time to provide support services, such as traffic control. Such uses can also subject neighboring residents and businesses to noise and traffic. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that special events and temporary outdoor promotions are conducted so as not to violate any other ordinance or regulation of the city, or cause detrimental effects to surrounding properties and the community-at-large. It is the intent of the city to protect the rights of the people to engage in expressive activities in the city's public places, as well as to regulate the time, place and manner of these activities in a reasonable and minimally restrictive fashion.</p>

The franchise shall also provide that the city may withdraw liquidated damages owed from the grantee's security deposit, after complying with the procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section. Liquidated damages shall commence on that date that performance was due and/or failed, and continue until the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the grantee has fully performed its obligations giving rise to the payment of liquidated damages.

In the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish separate prices for the combined services, the percentage that the price for the combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the individual services shall be prorated across all the services in the bundled package; provided, however, that the net revenues derived from services subject to mandatory tariff rates imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (or other governmental entity having such authority) shall be deducted from the combined revenue to determine the revenue subject to the franchise fee.

Assuming that there is no service subject to the mandated tariff rate, grantee would apply a twenty-five percent discount to each service.

                <p>This chapter aims to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare during the novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emergency by requiring grocery stores to provide hazard pay for grocery workers performing work in the city of American Canyon. Some grocery stores have voluntarily provided additional compensation, but others have not. Requiring competing grocery stores to provide hazard pay will ensure that grocery workers are compensated for the risks of working during a pandemic. Grocery workers face increased risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 because the nature of their work involves close contact with the public and co-workers, including individuals who are not showing symptoms of COVID-19 but who can spread the disease. Hazard pay also ensures the retention of these essential grocery store workers who are on the frontlines of this pandemic providing essential services and who are needed throughout the duration of the COVID-19 emergency.</p>

                <p>"Adverse action" means reducing the compensation to a grocery worker, garnishing gratuities, temporarily or permanently denying or limiting access to work, incentives, or bonuses, offering less desirable work, demoting, terminating, deactivating, putting a grocery worker on hold status, failing to rehire after a seasonal interruption of work, threatening, penalizing, retaliating, or otherwise discriminating against a covered employee.

                <p>"Covered employee" means a grocery worker who is entitled to hazard pay pursuant to this chapter.</p>
