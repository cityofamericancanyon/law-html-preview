The goal of LID is to mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, evaporate, and detain runoff close to the source of rainfall.</p>
                <p>"National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit" means a permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State Water Resources Control Board, or the California Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.
