                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)">(1)</span> Swainson's hawk.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)(a)">(a)</span> The applicant must provide a biological study from a qualified biologist evaluating the project site for the presence of ecologically valuable hawk foraging habitat. The study must include conclusions as to whether any loss of habitat due to the project would create a significant environmental effect requiring mitigation, applying the significance threshold found in California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15065, subdivision (a)(1) (whether the project would substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of the hawk). Any significant environmental effect to Swainson's hawk habitat identified in a study prepared by a qualified biologist would be mitigated through off-site preservation of habitat at a 1:1 ratio. A specific strategy for how to achieve such off-site preservation shall be prepared by the qualified biologist and submitted to the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)(b)">(b)</span> Pre-construction surveys for Swainson's hawk shall be conducted in the project site vicinity prior to initiation of project construction activities. Agency protocol for conducting nesting surveys for Swainson's hawk requires that three surveys be conducted during the nesting season, with the first one between March 20 and April 5, the second one between April 5 and April 20, and the third one between June 10 to July 30. Surveys shall be conducted each year following initiation of construction if project activities are delayed or discontinued for seven or more days prior to the first required survey period (March 20 to April 5) and are scheduled to recommence during the second survey period or before August 1. These pre-construction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a half-mile radius around all project activities and shall be completed for at least two survey periods immediately prior to commencement of project construction. Surveys shall be conducted in accordance with "Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley" issued by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) (then the California Department of Fish and Game) in 2000 (or as updated) to maximize the potential for locating nesting Swainson's hawk and reduce the potential for nest failures due to project activities and/or disturbances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)(c)">(c)</span> If no nesting Swainson's hawk are found during the first or second required survey period starting March 20 and extending to April 20, then project construction may commence. If during the third surveys (June 10 to July 30) Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting in the project vicinity and construction has commenced, it shall be assumed the Swainson's hawk commenced nesting and thus the Swainson's hawk are habituated to the ambient level of noise and disturbance emanating from the project site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)(d)">(d)</span> If Swainson's hawk are found to be nesting within 0.25 miles of the project site, a non-disturbance buffer shall be established to keep all construction activities a minimum of 0.25 miles from the nest site. CDFW shall be consulted regarding the adequacy of the buffer established by the qualified Raptor Biologist. At that time the necessity for acquiring a <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FGC&amp;sectionNum=2081" title="">Fish and Game section 2081</a> Incidental Take Permit (ITP) authorization would be determined. An ITP authorization shall be required if there were a valid concern the project activities would result in the "take" of an adult Swainson's hawk, eggs, or nestlings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(1)(e)">(e)</span> Surveys and the biological study shall be conducted by a qualified raptor biologist with at least a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science, familiarity with Swainson's hawk and its local ecology, and 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting Swainson's hawk pursuant to "Recommended timing and methodology for Swainson's Hawk Nesting Surveys in California's Central Valley" survey protocol. No disturbance such as construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified Raptor Biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on the monitoring of the active nest by a qualified Raptor Biologist.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(2)">(2)</span> Golden eagle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(2)(a)">(a)</span> No more than 30 days prior to the first ground disturbance activity, pre-construction golden eagle nesting surveys shall be conducted in the project vicinity by a qualified raptor biologist. The qualified raptor biologist shall have a minimum of a 4-year college degree in wildlife biology or related environmental science and at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting golden eagles and its local ecology. Preconstruction surveys shall include investigation of all potential nesting trees within a survey area determined by the qualified raptor biologist, but no less than a 1.0-mile radius around all project activities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(2)(b)">(b)</span> If active golden eagle nests are identified within any trees within the survey areas in a 1.0-mile radius of the project site, a qualified raptor biologist shall establish a protection buffer of approximately 1.0 mile that is adequate to ensure noise or activity from the project would not cause nest disturbance of young or adult bird mortality. Buffer zones may vary in size as some golden eagles are more acclimated to disturbance than others. Size of buffer zone may be modified by the qualified raptor biologist considering the type of construction activity that may occur and the behavioral factors and extent that golden eagle may have acclimated to disturbance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(2)(c)">(c)</span> No construction or earth moving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young golden eagles have fledged or that the nesting cycle is complete based on monitoring of the active nest by the qualified raptor biologist.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)">(3)</span> Northern harrier and short-eared owl.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)(a)">(a)</span> Prior to ground disturbance, a pre-construction nesting survey shall be conducted for northern harrier and short-eared owl by a qualified raptor biologist if construction is scheduled during the nesting season (February 1 through September 1). The qualified raptor biologist shall have at least 2 years of experience surveying for and detecting nesting northern harrier and short-eared owl.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)(b)">(b)</span> To determine whether northern harrier or short-eared owl is nesting on-site, a qualified Raptor Biologist(s) shall conduct walking transects through the project site grassland habitat searching for nests within a minimum 500-foot radius from the project site. Where the survey area encroaches onto private property not accessible to the public (e.g., fenced in commercial property, residential backyard, etc., the qualified raptor biologist shall either contact the property owner for permission to physically access the property or conduct a visual survey of adjacent areas by scanning with binoculars or a spotting scope.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)(c)">(c)</span> An active northern harrier or short-eared owl nest must be protected by implementing a minimum 500-foot radius buffer zone around the nest marked with orange construction fencing. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Size of buffer zone could be increased considering the type of construction activity that may occur, physical barriers between the construction site and active next, and the behavioral factors and extent that northern harrier or short-eared owl may have acclimated to disturbance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(C)(3)(d)">(d)</span> No construction or earthmoving activity shall occur within the established buffer zone until it is determined by a qualified raptor biologist that the young have fledged or that the nesting cycle is otherwise determined to be complete based on monitoring of the active nest by a qualified raptor biologist.</p>

Surveys shall be conducted within the project footprint and 100 feet from the construction limits for nesting passerines, 250 feet from the construction limits for nesting accipiters and a minimum of 500 feet from the construction limits for nesting raptors. If the survey area is found to be absent of nesting birds, no further mitigation would be required. However, if construction activities are delayed by more than 7 days, an additional nesting bird survey shall be performed. If bird nests are found, appropriate buffer zones shall be established around all active nests to protect nesting adults and their young from direct or indirect impacts related to project construction disturbance. Size of buffer zones shall be determined per recommendations of the qualified Biologist based on site conditions and species involved, but typical buffers around active nests are 500 feet for large raptors such as buteos, 250 feet for small raptors such as accipiters, and 100 feet for passerines (songbirds) and other bird species. For special status species, a 0.25-mile shall be established for nesting Swainson's hawk; 1.0 mile for golden eagle; and a 500-foot buffer for nesting tricolored blackbirds. If an active nest is located outside of the project site, the buffer shall be extended onto the project site and demarcated where it intersects the project site. Buffer zones shall be maintained until it can be documented that either the nest has failed, or the young have fledged.</p>
