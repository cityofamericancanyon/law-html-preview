                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Subdivisions in the RRH Zoning District shall be subject to the following standards:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> Residential lots shall vary significantly in size in order to create the openness and variation characteristic of a rural neighborhood. No more than two contiguous lots shall be of the same size. Lot size variations shall be achieved by varying lot area/lot widths. Parcel size variations on contiguous lots of one acre or less shall vary up or down a minimum of twenty-five percent in size. Contiguous lots larger than one acre shall vary up or down in size by ten percent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(b)">(b)</span> The subdivision design shall ensure protection of designated viewsheds from Newell Drive to the highest ridgeline located to the east of the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(c)">(c)</span> Each residential lot will identify a maximum building height that will enable other homes with sufficient elevation to achieve a view toward the Napa River wetlands. Technical information that enables identification of a maximum building height will include but not be limited to: lot placement within the subdivision, building envelope placement, and grading. The maximum building height will be recorded in the project CC&amp;Rs (Covenants, Codes and Restrictions).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(d)">(d)</span> Design guidelines addressing architecture for individual homes shall be prepared and submitted to the city of American Canyon, concurrently with submittal of a tentative subdivision map, master plan or specific plan. The design guidelines must be consistent with the General Plan Land Use Element Design Principles (Policy 1.11.5).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(e)">(e)</span> Native landscaping shall be provided in the Newell Drive setback area. The preliminary and final landscape improvement plans for this common area open space shall include clusters of native shrubs and trees to enhance the privacy and soften the visual form of future homes as viewed from public areas such as Newell Drive. Such landscape improvements shall be approved by the city and maintained by the subdivision's homeowner's association.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(f)">(f)</span> Streets within the RRH district may make use of a reduced overall paved width of not less than thirty feet, subject to approval of a design exception to be considered concurrently with the approval of a tentative subdivision map.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(a)">(a)</span> To determine potential impacts to viewsheds and neighboring properties, the applicant shall install story poles to provide a three-dimensional, full-scale, silhouette structure that outlines the location, bulk and mass that a proposed structure will occupy on a site prior to submittal of a building permit for any structure on a residential parcel.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(b)">(b)</span> Prior to submittal of a building permit for any structure or group of structures, the applicant shall submit written documentation from the applicable homeowner's association that the application complies with the design guidelines in the recorded CC&amp;Rs.</p>
