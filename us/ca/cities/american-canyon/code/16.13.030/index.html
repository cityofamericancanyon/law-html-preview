                <p><strong>3403.6.2.2 Substantial Structural Damage to Vertical Elements of the LateralâForce-Resisting System.</strong> A building that has sustained substantial structural damage to the vertical elements of its lateral-force-resisting system shall be evaluated and repaired in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3403.6.2.2.1 through 3403.6.2.2.3.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.2.1 Evaluation.</strong> The building shall be evaluated by a registered design professional, and the evaluation findings shall be submitted to the code official. The evaluation shall establish whether the damaged building, if repaired to its pre-damage state, would comply with the provisions of the building code. Wind forces for this evaluation shall be those prescribed in the building code. Seismic forces for this evaluation are permitted to be the reduced level seismic forces specified in Code Section 3403.6.1.1.3.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.2.2 Extent of Repair for Compliant Buildings.</strong> If the evaluation establishes compliance of the pre-damage building in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1, then repairs shall be permitted that restore the building to its pre-damage state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.2.3 Extent of Repair for Non-Compliant Buildings. </strong>If the evaluation does not establish compliance of the pre-damage building in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1, then the building shall be rehabilitated to comply with applicable provisions of the building code for load combinations including wind or seismic forces. The wind design level for the repair shall be as required by the building code in effect at the time of original construction unless the damage was caused by wind, in which case the design level shall be as required by the code in effect at the time of original construction or as required by the building code, whichever is greater. Seismic forces for this rehabilitation design shall be those required for the design of the predamaged building, but not less than the reduced level seismic forces specified in Section 3403.6.1.1.3. New structural members and connections required by this rehabilitation design shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.3 Substantial Structural Damage to Vertical Load-Carrying Components.</strong> Vertical load-carrying components that have sustained substantial structural damage shall be rehabilitated to comply with the applicable provisions for dead and live loads in the building code. Undamaged vertical load-carrying components that receive dead or live loads from rehabilitated components shall also be rehabilitated to carry the design loads of the rehabilitation design. New structural members and connections required by this rehabilitation design shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.3.1 Lateral Force-Resisting Elements.</strong> Regardless of the level of damage to vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system, if substantial structural damage to vertical load-carrying components was caused primarily by wind or seismic effects, then the building shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.1 and, if non-compliant, rehabilitated in accordance with Section 3403.6.2.2.3.</p>
                <p><strong>3403.6.2.4 Less than Substantial Structural Damage.</strong> For damage less than substantial structural damage, repairs shall be allowed that restore the building to its pre-damage state, using materials and strengths that existed prior to the damage. New structural members and connections used for this repair shall comply with the detailing provisions of the building code for new buildings of similar structure, purpose, and location.</p>
