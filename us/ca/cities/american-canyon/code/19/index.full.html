                <p>This chapter establishes two zoning districts to allow a broad range of commercial uses within those districts. The following commercial districts are hereby established:</p>
                <p>CC (community commercial) district: to accommodate a broad range of commercial uses that will serve local residents and the greater community and reduce the need for external trips to adjacent jurisdictions for goods and services, and provide shopping and service opportunities for commuters, visitors, and tourists. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</p>
                <p>CN (neighborhood commercial) district: to encourage a limited range of retail and service commercial uses that are oriented to the day-to-day needs of the local residents, at a scale compatible with adjacent neighborhoods. Also accommodates multifamily residential uses, especially in conjunction with a commercial use.</p>

Occupancy rates for seniors are significantly less than non-senior occupancy rates. Seniors make substantially fewer trips than non-seniors. Seniors drive fewer vehicles, and therefore require fewer parking spaces per housing unit than do non-seniors.

Therefore, if there is no discretionary process to administer changes from senior to non-senior mobilehome parks, the city's zero water footprint policy will not be applied to such land use changes.

                <p>For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined as follows:</p>
                <p>"Appraised valuation" means either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes, updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the last valuation, or the valuation determined by a professionally-recognized property appraiser.</p>
                <p>"Cost" of renovation or repair or replacement means the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation, repair, or replacement. Renovation, repair, or replacement costs shall be determined by the building official, whose decision may be appealed to the city council. The "cost" of such renovation of repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work, and no person may seek to avoid the intent of this chapter by doing such work incrementally.</p>
                <p>"Nonconforming lots" means a lot, the area dimensions, or location of which was lawful prior to the effective date of this title, or any amendment thereto, but which fails by reason of such adoption, revision, or amendment to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.</p>
                <p>"Nonconforming structure" means any structure that was lawfully established and in compliance with the applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in this title or any amendment thereto became effective, but which, due to the application of this title or any amendment thereto, no longer complies with all the applicable regulations and standards of development in the zoning district in which it is located.</p>
                <p>"Nonconforming use" means any use of land or property that was lawfully established and in compliance with all applicable ordinances and laws at the time the ordinance codified in this title, or any amendment thereto, became effective, but which, due to the application of this title or any amendment thereto is a use not listed as permitted, accessory, or subject to permit in the zoning district in which it is located. "Nonconforming use" shall also include uses reclassified from permitted to subject to permit in the same district, and uses made nonconforming by the addition of a development standard previously not required for such use in the same zoning classification, where such added standard is specified to be a "condition of use."</p>

For example, the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for twelve months shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continually maintained.</p>
