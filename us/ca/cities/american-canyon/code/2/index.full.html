                <p>The city manager shall develop and implement disciplinary actions which are intended to be corrective and progressive in nature with the objective of obtaining compliance with rules, orders, procedures, standards of conduct and/or expected job performance. Corrective or disciplinary action taken should be limited in severity so that it is commensurate with the alleged infraction(s). While supervisors are encouraged to use a progressive approach in most circumstances, serious infractions of disciplinary standards call for an appropriate response. Counseling, warnings, reprimands, and suspensions may be bypassed if the employee's actions justify a more severe response.</p>
