An application must be filed for an initial and renewal cable system franchise, or for approval of a transfer.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(B)(1)(c)">(c)</span> A map of the general route the facility will follow; a designation of the portions of the system that will be placed aboveground and the portions that will be placed underground, and the construction techniques that the operator proposes to use in installing the system aboveground and underground; a schedule for construction of the facility, describing when and where construction will begin, how it will proceed, benchmarks indicating the schedule completion of portions of the system and when construction will be completed; and the expected effect on right-of-way usage, including information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(B)(1)(i)">(i)</span> An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of: (1) the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; (2) the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals; or (3) the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of communications systems;</p>

If an applicant has no other franchise in California, it shall provide the information for its operations in other states;</p>
