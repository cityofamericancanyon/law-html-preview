                <p>The streets and public areas within the city should be readily accessible and available to the residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for which they were intended.

Camping on public property without proper sanitary measures adversely affects the public health, safety, and welfare of the city and interferes with the intended use and enjoyment of public property. The purpose of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/12.06" title="Chapter 12.06 CAMPING UPON PUBLIC PROPERTIES">this chapter</a> is to maintain streets, parks, and other public areas within the city in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition and to adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the community, while recognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping and camp facilities associated with special events can be beneficial to the cultural and educational climate in the city.
