                <p>"Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located.</p>
                <p>"Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.</p>
                <p>"Apex" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front.</p>

                <p>"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.</p>
                <p>"Area of special flood hazard." See "Special flood hazard area."</p>
                <p>"Area of special flood-related erosion hazard" is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).</p>
                <p>"Area of special mudslide (i.e. mudflow) hazard" is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).</p>
                <p>"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/8.16" title="Chapter 8.16 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p>"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e., below ground level) on all sides.</p>

A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:</p>
                <p class=" text-indent-2"><strong>1.</strong> Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and</p>
                <p class=" text-indent-2"><strong>2.</strong> The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood.</p>

                <p>"Coastal high hazard area" means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action from storms or seismic sources. It is an area subject to high velocity waters, including coastal and tidal inundation or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as zone V1—V30, VE or V.</p>
                <p>"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.</p>
                <p>"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings permanent structure or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.</p>
                <p>"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.</p>

                <p>"Flood-related erosion area" or "flood-related erosion prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.</p>

In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increase risk of damage from floods, which future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.</p>

The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.</p>
                <p>"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.</p>

The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences.</p>

                <p>The variance criteria set forth in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/8.16.240" title="8.16.240 Nature of variances.">this section</a> of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/8.16" title="Chapter 8.16 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS">this chapter</a> would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/8.16" title="Chapter 8.16 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS">this chapter</a> are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.</p>
