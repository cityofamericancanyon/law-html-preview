There are six stages of strategies, each of which builds upon its predecessor stage and are to be implemented as the severity of conditions increase. Stage 6 can be implemented at any time due to catastrophic events and conditions, either natural or unnatural, including flooding, major fire emergencies, earthquakes, regional power outages, water contamination, and emergencies other than water shortage. No customer of the city shall make, cause, use, or permit the use of water from the city for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, governmental, or any other purpose in a manner contrary to any provision of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/13.14" title="Chapter 13.14 WATER CONSERVATION PLAN">this chapter</a>, or in an amount in excess of what is permitted in accordance with the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/13.14" title="Chapter 13.14 WATER CONSERVATION PLAN">this chapter</a>. The reductions shall be based upon the amount of water used during that base period defined as the amount of water used on a customer's property during the corresponding monthly billing period in the previous year, or other year as may be designated by the city council. New services or services without a base year billing history shall be allotted on comparable customer usage.</p>
