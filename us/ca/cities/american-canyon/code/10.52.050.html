The method described in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/10.52.050" title="10.52.050 Requirements.">this section</a> must be followed when an employer chooses to use a random sample to meet the requirements of subsection K of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/10.52.050" title="10.52.050 Requirements.">this section</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(1)(a)">(a)</span> Subsection (G)(3) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/10.52.050" title="10.52.050 Requirements.">this section</a> provides for an option for larger work sites to calculate AVR or VER based upon a random sample of the employee population. The random sample option is available only for work sites where four hundred or more employees start work during the peak period (six a.m. through ten a.m.).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(1)(b)">(b)</span> The size of the random sample depends upon the number of employees who start work during the peak period at the work site. The means to determine the minimum size of the random sample is described in subsection (L)(2)(b) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/10.52.050" title="10.52.050 Requirements.">this section</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(1)(c)">(c)</span> The sample must be selected as described in subsection (L)(2)(d) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/10.52.050" title="10.52.050 Requirements.">this section</a>. Once the sample group has been selected, the employer is not permitted to send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group. This will invalidate the results of the survey and void the employer's option to utilize the random sample method.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(1)(d)">(d)</span> A high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate AVR or VER for the work site. The employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey from each employee in the sample. All nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive along commuters (i.e. commuting in a single occupant vehicle) for purposes of calculating the work site AVR or VER.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)">(2)</span> Basic Random Sample Selection Methodology.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)(a)">(a)</span> The employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the work site, in alphabetical order, and assign a consecutive number to each employee.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)(b)">(b)</span> The employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula, where n is the sample size and N is the number of employees who start work between six am and ten a.m.</p>
                <p>A sample size of "n" based on this formula should produce an AVR or VER with a sampling error of at most plus or minus 0.05, with ninety-five percent probability. The sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)(d)">(d)</span> After the sample size has been determined, the employer has two options for selecting the sample.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)(d)(i)">(i)</span> Use a computer program to select distinct random numbers from the employee list (e.g., two hundred seventy-eight distinct random numbers between one and one thousand, where one thousand employees start working during the peak period).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(L)(2)(d)(ii)">(ii)</span> Select employees from the list based upon a sampling interval and random starting number.</p>
                <p>To determine the sample interval, the employer shall divide the total population of employees who start work during the six a.m. through ten am. peak period by the sample size and round the result down to the nearest integer.</p>
                <p>Example: If a work site has one thousand employees who start work during the peak period and the sample size is two hundred seventy-eight, then the sampling interval equals 1,000 divided by 278 = 3.6. The 3.6 is rounded down to 3 to produce the sampling interval. Therefore, every third name on the list shall be selected beginning at a random starting number X where X is between 1 and 3. If X equals 3, then the sample would include numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc., until the required 278 numbers have been selected.</p>
