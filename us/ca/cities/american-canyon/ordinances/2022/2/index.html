                <p>WHEREAS, Climate change represents a growing danger to human health, safety, economic prosperity, basic services, and natural resources. The State of California as a whole, and Napa County residents, the economy, and environment have experienced adverse effects associated with climate change, such as a prolonged wildfire seasons and firestorms, rising temperatures, mudslides, severe droughts, property destruction and damage to infrastructure; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, American Canyon has a long history of supporting policies to protect the environment. In 2013, American Canyon's Energy Efficiency Climate Action Plan (EECAP) was the first Climate Action Plan adopted in Napa County; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on June 18, 2019, the City Council approved a Countywide Commitment to Address Climate Change Proclamation declaring the City's support of local actions to address climate change including joining the Napa Countywide Climate Action Committee (CAC); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on April 6, 2021, due to concerns of greenhouse gas emissions as well as market saturation and Broadway District Specific Plan (BDSP) community character, the City Council adopted Urgency Ordinance 2021-03 to impose an immediate 10-Month, 15-day moratorium on processing discretionary entitlements to establish, use, and operate new fuel stations within the City of American Canyon; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, according to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), transportation accounts for about 40% of the state's greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in the State which places transportation as the leading source of GHG pollution in California; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, as of 2017, the CARB reports that passenger vehicles represent the largest single source of transportation GHG emissions in California; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, according to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), widespread use of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) will improve California's air quality and help meet California's GHG reductions targets; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a ZEV is defined as plug-in hybrid electric, full battery electric, hydrogen, and fuel cell vehicles because they have no greenhouse gas or air pollutant tailpipe emissions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, according to Caltrans, ZEVs are typically cheaper to fuel than gasoline-powered vehicles, and there are an increasing number of models to choose from, including longer-range Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), All-wheel-drive vehicles, SUVs, and mini-vans; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in September 2020, as part of an effort to address the impacts of climate change caused by transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-79-20 to require all in-state sales of new passenger vehicles be ZEV by 2035; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Governor's Executive Order sets a further State goal that 100 percent of medium- and heavy-duty (MD/HD) vehicles be zero-emission by 2045 for all operations where feasible, and by 2035 for drayage trucks, and transition to 100 percent zero-emission off-road vehicles and equipment by 2035 where feasible; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City is an active member of the Napa County Climate Action Committee and this Committee is contemplating policy amendments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Napa County; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, there are three existing fuel stations in American Canyon and one approved fuel station in American Canyon and the existing and proposed fuel stations do not include any Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) fueling infrastructure; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 65300 of the State Planning and Zoning Law, the City of American Canyon (City) has adopted a General Plan to provide comprehensive long-range planning and a blueprint of the City's future form, including land use and circulation maps that specify the roadway network and the distribution of types and intensities of land; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on July 22, 2021, the Planning Commission recommended City Council approval of a General Plan Amendment to incorporate climate change, adaptation, and greenhouse gas reduction policies into the Land Use Element (Resolution 2021-16); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on September 7, 2021, the City Council approved climate change, adaptation, and greenhouse gas reduction policies into the General Plan (Resolution 2021-60); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on November 16, 2021, the City Council issued a Climate change Emergency Proclamation that acknowledges climate change caused by human activity represents a growing danger to human health, safety, and economic prosperity, and the window of opportunity for long term climate preservation is rapidly closing and commits to a goal of net zero climate pollution, measured in terms of net contribution to excess trapped heat, by or before 2030 by implementing immediate and sustained actions in support of its achievement; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), (Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq.), the proposed Zoning Code and Specific Plan Amendment is categorically exempt from environmental review in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15307 Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of Natural Resources, and CEQA Guidelines Section 15308 Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment. CEQA Guidelines Section 15307 and 15308 are applicable because the proposed Zoning Code and Specific Plan amendments are intended to address climate change impacts that pose an immediate and growing threat to California's economy, environment, and public health; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a duly-noticed public hearing was held by the City of American Canyon Planning Commission on October 28, 2021 and December 16, 2021 on the subject project, and recommends City Council approval; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a duly-noticed public hearing was held by the City of American Canyon City Council on January 18, 2022 on the subject project, at which time all those in attendance were given the opportunity to speak on this proposal and to submit comments.</p>
                <p>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED that the City Council of the City of American Canyon, having considered all the evidence, including any submitted by member of the public, hereby approves Zoning Code Amendments as shown below.</p>
                <p id="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/ordinances/2022/2#1"><span id="1"><span class="level-num">Section 1. </span></span>FINDINGS.  Based on the following evidence and as required by Zoning Ordinance Section 19.48.040 C, the City Council finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1a.">a.</span> The amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the general plan.</p>
                <p><em>General Plan Opportunities and Constraints #15 states that</em> c<em>limate change impacts pose an immediate and growing threat to California's economy, environment, and public health. The effects of climate change in American Canyon include increased temperatures, decreased air quality, reduced precipitation, flooding, a prolonged wildfire seasons and firestorms, mudslides, severe droughts, reduced water supply, property destruction, and damage to infrastructure.</em></p>
                <p>
                  <em>To address these constraints, the proposed ordinance will fulfill related General Plan Policy 1.37.2 which states: "Recognizing that the transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in American Canyon and in California more broadly, prohibit construction of new fossil-fuel stations in American Canyon."   The proposed Ordinance would achieve Policy 1.37.2 by prohibiting new fossil fuel stations in American Canyon.  The proposed ordinance includes reasonable measures to address nonconforming gas stations and unforeseen "Force Majeure" events that cause a gap in gas station operations.</em>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="1b.">b.</span> The amendment is consistent with the purposes of this title, as set forth in Chapter 19.01, Authority, Purposes and Effects of the Zoning Ordinance.</p>
                <p>
                  <em>The amendment is consistent with the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance to protect and promote the public health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience, aesthetics, prosperity, and general welfare consistent with the City Council Climate Change Emergency Proclamation that acknowledges climate change caused by human activity represents a growing danger to human health, safety, and economic prosperity, and commits to a goal of net zero climate pollution, measured in terms of net contribution to excess trapped heat, by or before 2030 by implementing immediate and sustained actions in support of its achievement.</em>
