                <p>WHEREAS, the City of American Canyon ("City") does not presently regulate firearm storage within residential locations;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, firearm injuries have a significant adverse public health and safety impact nationally, regionally, and locally;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, improperly stored firearms may result in accidental firearm injuries and/or deaths, particularly in homes with children;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in California, numerous people die each year from injuries related to firearms, and many more are hospitalized for non-fatal gunshot wounds;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, having a loaded or unlocked firearm in the home has been associated with an increased risk of firearm-related injury and death, as well as theft of the firearm;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a firearm stored while loaded or unlocked increases the risk of an accidental shooting;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, quick access to a loaded firearm heightens the risk that a person's impulsive decision to commit suicide may be carried out without reflection or seeking help, and that the impulsive attempt will be fatal;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, utilizing gun locks or lock boxes when storing firearms in the home reduces the risk of firearm injury and death, as well as theft;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, keeping a firearm locked when it is not being carried ensures that it cannot be accessed or used by others without the owner's knowledge or permission, decreasing the risk that the gun will be used to commit suicide, homicide, or inflict injury, whether intentionally or unintentionally;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the safe storage of firearms;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, both gun control and gun rights activists, including the National Rifle Association, endorse the use of locking devices when storing firearms to ensure that unauthorized and untrained persons cannot access firearms to inflict injury or cause death;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, requiring stored, unsupervised firearms to be secured with gun locks or in a locked container does not substantially burden the right or ability to use firearms for self-defense in the home;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the proposed locking requirements apply to firearms that are not being legally carried. Legal firearm owners and adults over 18 may still carry loaded and unlocked firearms in their home at any time consistent with applicable law. The safe storage requirements also permit legal owners to store their firearms fully loaded consistent with applicable law if they wish;</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, firearm security does not preclude quick access. Portable lockboxes with simplex or biometric locks can store loaded handguns such that they are always within easy reach on counters, tables, or nightstands. Such safely stored handguns may be more quickly and easily retrieved for use in self-defense than unlocked handguns hidden away in seldom-used or remote locations; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City Council finds that requiring safe storage of firearms would constitute a sensible safety regulation and would not be unduly burdensome for firearm owners.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE, THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON DOES HEREBY ORDAIN AS FOLLOWS:</p>
