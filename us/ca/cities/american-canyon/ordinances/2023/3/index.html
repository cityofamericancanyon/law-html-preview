Consequently, and in accordance with CEQA Section 21084(a) and both Section 15002(i)(1) – lack of Local Jurisdictional Discretion – and Section 15061(b)(3) – General Rule of Exemption – of the CEQA Guidelines, the ordinance adoption is exempt from CEQA review and a Notice of Exemption has been prepared for this proposed amendment.</p>
