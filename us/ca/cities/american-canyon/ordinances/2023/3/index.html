Consequently, and in accordance with CEQA Section 21084(a) and both Section 15002(i)(1) â lack of Local Jurisdictional Discretion â and Section 15061(b)(3) â General Rule of Exemption â of the CEQA Guidelines, the ordinance adoption is exempt from CEQA review and a Notice of Exemption has been prepared for this proposed amendment.</p>
