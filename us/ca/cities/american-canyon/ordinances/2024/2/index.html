                <p>WHEREAS, California has established the ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2045, which will require significant reductions and mitigation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, industrial land uses like freight, warehouse, and logistics centers often emit substantial GHG emissions in their construction and operation, especially due to heavy-duty truck traffic; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, new developments and land use proposals present some of the best and most efficient opportunities to reduce and mitigate GHG emissions; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, mitigation of GHG emissions from individual projects often reduces co-emitted air pollutants, with advantages for nearby air quality and human health; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the City of American Canyon ("City") seeks to be an environmental leader by attracting industrial development that meets the highest standards of environmental sustainability; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the California Environmental Quality Act (<a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&amp;sectionNum=21000" title="">Pub. Res. Code § 21000</a> et sea., "CEQA") requires lead agencies to choose a threshold of significance to evaluate greenhouse gas emissions; lead agencies must choose a threshold that is supported by substantial evidence and captures all significant impacts; and lead agencies have the discretion to create their own threshold or adopt one developed by an expert agency; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, in 2022 the Bay Area Air Quality Management District ("BAAQMD") issued guidance recommending GHG significance thresholds of general applicability for residential and commercial projects; but did not recommend a threshold for industrial land uses; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, BAAQMD's thresholds for residential and commercial projects are insufficient for industrial land uses because they do not capture or consider the significant sources of GHG emissions from industrial land uses; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, until BAAQMD develops a GHG threshold appropriate for industrial uses, the City will adopt its own threshold standards relying on the analysis and implement record of other rule-making actions of other local agencies to determine a threshold of applicability to industrial land uses; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") has developed a threshold of significance for industrial land uses that is supported by substantial evidence and captures the significant sources of GHG impacts; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a threshold of significance that combines BAAQMD's baseline threshold with the SCAQMD's threshold will capture the presently known GHG emissions from industrial land uses; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a duly-noticed public hearing was held by the City of American Canyon Planning Commission on January 25, 2024 on the subject ordinance, and recommends City Council approval; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a duly-noticed public hearing was held by the City of American Canyon City Council on February 6, 2024 on the subject ordinance, at which time all those in attendance were given the opportunity to speak on this proposal and to submit comments.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON DOES HEREBY ORDAIN THAT <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/american-canyon/code/19.01.061" title="19.01.061 Industrial Use Greenhouse Gas Standards">SECTION 19.01.061</a> IS HEREBY ADDED TO THE MUNICIPAL CODE OF THE CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON AS FOLLOWS:</p>
