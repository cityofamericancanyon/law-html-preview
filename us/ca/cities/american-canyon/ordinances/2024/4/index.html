                <p><span class="level-num" id="7">Section 7.</span> CEQA FINDINGS. The City Council finds the municipal code amendments are exempt from environmental review under CEQA because the amendments are consistent with State law that preempt any inconsistent local ordinance.  Thus, the City's action is not creating a new land use regulation and it can be seen with certainty that no environmental impacts will result from the City's action. Consequently, and in accordance with CEQA Section 21084(a) and both Section 15002(i)(1) â lack of Local Jurisdictional Discretion â and Section 15061(b)(3) â General Rule of Exemption â of the CEQA Guidelines, the ordinance adoption is exempt from CEQA review and a Notice of Exemption has been prepared for this proposed amendment.</p>
